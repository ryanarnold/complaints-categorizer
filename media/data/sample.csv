CAAC-20130008,"Subject: Follow-up on Complaint
Good morning USec. Yabut:  Yesterday, I visited the DPWH to follow-up a complaint filed by then Bgy. Capt. Sofronio C. Varona, my father-in-law, re the farm to market road undertaken in Bgy. San Roque, Daram, Samar in 2008 at a cost of P4.7 M. that was tainted by gross anomalies resulting in massive under deliveries of materials & shoddy work. Then DE Jose Balite visited the proj. site with his staff & made a list of corrective work that needed to be done to complete the proj. Not one of these corrective work was done. The undersized pipes are still there as evidence. This complaint was made against Engr. Ruben de los Reyes of your 2nd Samar Engineering Dist. based in Catbalogan, Samar as we found out later that he was the one who actually sub-contracted the work on this proj. We would like to get a copy of the investigation report on this case. Two investigators from the Central Ofc. went to Bgy. San Roque, Daram  but they did not talk to the workers concerned nor to the officials of the Bgy. The Bgy. Capt. was never informed the result of such investigation. On the contrary, despite the complaints against Engr. de los Reyes he has been promoted to Asst. Dist. Engr. It has been many years since these complaints were filed & several letters have been sent to various DPWH & COA officials concerned. We did not get even the courtesy of a response to these letters as required by Civil Service rules. I was advised at your PIO & CIVIC to communicate with you directly on this matter. I hope that, with this e-mail, we will finally get a copy of the investigation report on this complaint. Thank you. We look forward to hearing soon from USec. Yabut as we were told that CIVIC has no record of this complaint.",1/7/2013 8:42

Subject: FW: Project Diversion of Sabangan-Balili-Sagada road
Sir, With regards to your email message, according to CAR Director Edilberto P. Carabbacan, they already requested priority funding for the Balili (Bontoc)-Suyo-Ambasing (Sagada) local road which connects to the Dantay-Sagada Road. 
Further, DOT-DAR Regional Director Purificacion S. Suanding-Molintas in her letter dated 14 December 2012 to CAR Regional Director Carabbacan, said that originally, the programmed Sabangan-Sagada Road project, which is to be funded from the DOT-DPWH CY 2013 Convergence Project amounting to P100 Million, has passed the Tourism Road Infrastructure Project Prioritization Criteria (TRIPPC) and has likewise been validated by a composite team from NEDA, DPWH and Mountain Province Provincial Tourism Office (please see attached copy).  Thank you sir.",1/7/2013 8:56

Macaas, Catmon, Cebu wherein a few months after the works it has already caved in and also the shoulder is not being filled up with filling materials. right now, it's very dangerous because when you're driving you can't divert to the shoulder as it's elevation compared to the road is very low. i think dpwh is waiting for an accident to happen before this is corrected. i wonder whose responsibility is this, the contractor or dpwh?",1/2/2013 13:16

Good day Ma'am,
Thank you so much for entertaining my suggestion. I truly hope someday, if not this year, Materials Engineers from UP Diliman and Mapua Institute of Technology will be given the opportunity to take the accreditation exam and become part of the DPWH..
God bless us all!
