        "body": "The Honorable Secretary\nDepartment of Public Works and Highways\nPort Area\nManila\n\nSir:\n\nI accidentally came into possession of a leaflet with an inscription as: Secretary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Corner: Let us know what you think: - this leaflet encouraged and emboldened me to write this letter.\nMy concern is about the Road Widening Project that your Department is presently implementing and constructing at the Capital town of Virac, province of Catanduanes.\nPrimordially, I am personally pleased by this project because it serves, among others as a timely solution to an increasing vehicular and pedestrian traffic, now experienced in this town. Please note that the road, upon which your project is going on, traverses the area where usually populated establishments are to be found, such as, the Provincial Hospital, the Airport and Catanduanes State University to name some.\nThe main intention of this letter is to call the attention and bring to the knowledge of your good office and person the many shortcomings or defects in the construction of the above-mentioned project which I have personally noticed and observed in my capacity as a non-engineer person. Such observations are the following:\nThe Road-widening project includes the construction of a drainage system in the form of a line-canal underneath the concrete pavement. However, the drainage system, part of the widening works is so constructed that it avoids as it swerves away from private structures built along the right-of-way portion of the area traversed by the drainage system. As a result, the finished portion of the project appear zigzagging. This observation is best manifested in the following private structures found setting outright on the area of right of way of the project to wit:\n1. Portion fronting Funenaria Bugtong \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the drainage was made to swerve away from the establishment as it passes in front of the funeral parlor. Reports however has it that in the construction of the building of said funeral house, its owner was made to sign a waiver that he is to remove the structure when the government should need the area.\n2. Portions of the total length of the drainage system were constructed inside concrete fences of some residential houses but it left behind the fences untouched negating the very purpose of the project which is to widen the National Road.\nRecently, however, said fences were now removed but leaving behind fences belonging to former Governor Leandro Verceles Jr. and one belonging to a certain Segundo Gianan, both of whom are influential family in this province. As a result, the project is a picture of zigzag pathway alongside the more or less straight national road.\n3. Portion of the Project near and horizontal to the concrete fence of the airport is now completed, but the work left behind a hilly or a protruding concrete pavement not visible from a distance. The uneven pavement makes that portion of the national road hazardous.\n4. Before the construction of present drainage system, there was already an existing open line canal in front of the airport runway. This line canal cater to the floodwaters naturally flowing from the runway through holes at the foot of the concrete fence saving the national road from flooding.\nPresent construction works discarded the old open canal and constructed in its instead a closed drainage system. Consequently, depriving floodwaters its natural flow from the runway to the drainage system. As a result, the highway floods when it rains, which was not the case with the old open canal system.\n5. At the junction of the national road and Moonwalk road, a provincial road, there is an existing lateral drainage system that directs the flow of waters to the open line canal along Moonwalk road. The construction work of the new drainage system disregarded the simple fact that the old lateral drainage system is too narrow in width to accommodate the increased volume of floodwaters that flow under the expanded drainage system of subject project.\n6. Also, because of the No. 5 circumstance, the bulk of the floodwaters will flow directly to the low grounds where the Provincial Hospital and many residential houses are located. This may lead to floodings in said area. It must be noted that the purpose of the lateral drainage canal was to redirect the flow of floodwaters to the open line canal along Moonwalk Road where existing drainage system could accommodate larger volume of floodwaters. Again, this simple engineering factor was evidently ignored.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, we respectfully request your good office to conduct a thorough investigation so as to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings in the implementation and construction of the subject Road Widening Project.\n  \nRespectfully Yours,'",

Tiling, Cauayan, Negros Occidental papuntang bayan ng Cauayan. Sa nasasakupan ng Brgy. Tiling ay may binungkal na dalawang maliliit na tulay na kung tutuusin ay hindi umabot sa sampung metro (10 meters) ang bawat isa. Ito ay sinimulang bungkalin at isara sa trapiko halos mahigit isang taon na ang nakalilipas (more or less). Naging sagabal ito sa daloy ng trapiko sa bahaging ito ng National Highway dahil sa kawalan ng tamang bantay. Isa pa sa nagpalala sa sitwasyon ay ang kasalukuyang kalagayan ng mga tulay na ito na ayon sa aming pagmamatyag ay may ganitong problema: 1. Kawalan ng tinatawag na Project Information Board na naglalaman ng petsa kung kalian inumpisahan at matatapos ang proyekto, pangalan ng contractor ng proyekto, kabuuhang halaga ng proyekto at lugar ng proyekto; 2. Sabay na binungkal at isinara ang dalawang tulay at sabay rin na hindi ginagawa; 3. Kawalan ng nakaduty na mga \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlagmen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d na magbabantay sa mga paparating na sasakyan at magkontrol sa trapiko; 4. Kawalan ng mga warning device kung gabi na maaring maging dahilan ng mga di inaasahang aksidente; 5. Sa mahigit isang taon na pagsara sa mga tulay na ito, at matapos ilagay ang mga kongretong poste, nawalan na ng nagtatrabaho; 6. Kawalan ng mga equipments na magpapadali sa pagtrabaho \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nagkaroon ng heavey equipment, sira naman at yon lang ang tinatrabaho ng iisang tao sa tuwing kami ay dumadaan Sa mga dahilang ito, nais naming isangguni sa inyong Opisina, bilang tagapangasiwa ng mga proyektong katulad nito ang mga sumusunod: 1. Kailan maipagpapatuloy ang pagtrabaho sa mga tulay na ito? 2. Kailan matatapos ang proyektong ito? 3. Bakit walang nakapaskil na pangalan ng contractor sa lugar ng proyekto na sa alituntunin ng Department of Public Works and Highways, bawat proyekto ay dapat nakalagay ang pangalan ng contractor? 4. Bakit kailangang sabay na bungkalin at isara ang dalawang tulay kung di naman pala sabay na gagawin? Bilang mga mamamayan na palaging bumabaybay sa pangunahing kalsadang ito, nais naming maisaayos ang mga ito upang mawala ang mga agam-agam ng naming sa kinauukulan. Hangad naming ang inyong agarang aksyon sa reklamong ito. Sa bawat araw na dumaraan, pumapatak ang pera na taumbayan sa mga proyektong ito. Sana naman ay makita ng taumbayan na tunay nga na ang buwis na ibinabayad namin ay napupunta sa tamang proyekto at hindi sa nabubulok na poste, kinakalawang na mga bakal, renta sa sirang makinarya at bayad sa mga taong walang ginagawa. Kung tunay nga na kayo ay instrument ng programa ng \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDaang Matuwid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hinihiling namin ang matuwid na pagpapaliwanag tungkol ditto.'",

Napaka delikado po ang lugar na ito dahil gilid po ito ng creek at ilang beses nang natibag ang riprap dito sa paghukay nila ng lupa at pagputol ng puno.\n\n3. Bumara ang mga bato sa ilog dahilan ng pagtaas ng tubig sa ilog na halos umabot na sa bubong ng ibang bahay noong bagyong Undoy.\n\n4. Walang habas na pagkalkal ng lupa sa gilid ng kalsada dahil pinapatag nila sa ibaba. Nagmumukhang bangin na po ang gilid ng highway. Pagdating ng tag-ulan, tibag na ulit ang panibagong rip-rap.

I would like to complain about a recently repaired stretch of road here in Bacolod City, specifically the Alijis Murcia road as this road had several sections repaired (finished around last month). Although it was finished only recently (last month), the cement portions have began to peel off revealing the stones underneath used in making the concrete. I have inquired around and the people I asked said that this is called scaling and should not happen for a long time. I am complaining as a private citizen as I have noted that several road repairs in Bacolod recently finished also exhibit this poor quality of construction. I am not sure if this is the same company that you contracted but I hope that you give this the attention it deserves. Under the \"Daang Matuwid,\" we hoped that the quality of public construction would be better than the previous. If this shoddy and poor quality work continues and is allowed to continue by the DPWH, our country is going nowhere and all the slogans we see on your website and on TV are simply just that.

From November 2014 until May this year, the Siocon River had very shallow waters due to the occurrence of drought, which would have been the right time for the contractor to fast-track the project. But for a long time, they managed to construct only a platform for their crane, which at this time, serves as a choke point of the swollen flood waters of the Siocon River. The platform, now constructed halfway of the river's width, acts as an obstruction to the free flow of water, which would cause a backflow, overflow the riverbank, and eventually inundate several low-lying barangays. For this reason, this representation - the designated MDRRMO of Siocon - earnestly request intervention of DPWH to direct the contractor for the immediate deconstruction of the dam-platform to prevent potential disastrous flooding of the municipality.

The signs which are placed about 50-100 meters before the site of road repair says: \"Sorry for the inconvenience, road repair ahead\". Should it be more proper to have signs such as, \"WARNING or CAUTION: Reduce speed or slow down, road repair ahead. Sorry for the inconvenience\" which are placed at regular intervals meters ahead of the actual road repair sight?\n3. The area is downhill/uphill, depending on where you are coming from.

The last reply dated January 27 from your District Engineer says: \"After effecting the proper and appropriate coordination with the City Government, the Contractor has already resumed the project implementation and shall complete the project within this month.\" Today is March 21 and I want to show you the development of your project. Please see attached files named \"Picture 1 Before\" and Picture 1 Now\" also the files \"Picture 2 Before\" and \"Picture 2 Now\". You can see that there was no development in your project. How can you \"complete the project within this month\", as you claimed? My observation about your project is that, there are numerous projects being implemented in the City of Iloilo simultaneously and you awarded the contract to only certain contractor WITHOUT CHECKING IF THIS CONTRACTOR IS CAPABLE WITH MANPOWER to do the job. You can not see any worker at daytime working in this project, they only comes at night, few of them, and work for short hours then leave. They will come back again after 3 to 5 days to work again because the contractor is pulling them out to work on another project in the city. \"Picture 3\" shows the status of their work 4 days ago...nothing happened after that. I wonder if the district engineer is also checking their work. Does DPWH impose fines to contractor who failed to complete the project on time? surely they have Surety bond before they start the project. We, the taxpayers, are paying for this project cost. The project started FEBRUARY 2014 with a Contract Completion of 60 days and now its OVER ONE (1) YEAR and still not finish. I hope you will do something NOW about this matter. Thank you.'",

Halos isang linggo matapos ilathala ng Angono Rizal News Online (aRNO) ang dalawang taon nang nabibinbin na tulay sa Darangan, personal na pinuntahan ng aRNO kaninang Huwebes ng umaga, January 21, ang munisipyo ng Binangonan upang kunin ang update, ang kanilang pahayag, at para sa patas na pag-uulat ukol sa developing story na ito. Partikular na pinuntahan ng aRNO ang Engineering Department pero wala umano ang otorisadong magsalita ukol dito. Hindi rin pinapasok ang aRNO sa nasabing opisina pero may dalawang staff dito ang kumausap sa aRNO sa lobby. Humingi ng pahintulot ang aRNO sa babae at lalaki na staff para makuha ang kanilang pangalan para sa ulat na ito, pero tumanggi sila. Ayon sa dalawang staff, maging ang Pamahalaang Bayan ng Binangonan ay nababahala sa mabagal na paggawa sa tulay na proyekto ng DPWH Region IV-A. Ayon pa sa nakausap ng aRNO, ang dahilan kung bakit hindi pa rin natatapos ang tulay ay dahil sa hindi pa rin umano natatapos ng Manila Water na ayusin ang mga tubo at daluyan ng tubig na maaapektuhan sa paggawa ng tulay. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMasikip din kasi yung lugar kaya hindi nagkakasya ang mga malalaking equipment na kailangan para sa paggawa ng tulay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wika ng nakausap ng aRNO. Ang paliwanag ng dalawang staff ay halos katulad din ng comment ng isang mambabasa ng aRNO sa nasabing isyu. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTinanong ko yung kaibigan ko sa DPWH (kung) ano nangyari dyan sa tulay. Delay daw yan kasi bukod sa pinakamasikip na tulay daw yan sa Binangonan na part ng widening project eh ang tagal umaksyon ng PLDT MERALCO at Manila Waters. Hirap daw heavy equipment dyan kasi nakadikit sa residential at commercial building pero tentative date daw ng tapos nyan eh sa February or March. Naka-fabricate na yung part na ikakabit daw dyan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wika ni aRNO reader Edmund Dantes. Nang tanungin din ang staff sa nasabing opisina kung matatapos ngayong taon ang tulay, hindi naman ito tiyak na nasagot ng kausap ng aRNO dahil depende nga ito sa ikikilos ng Manila Water at DPWH Region IV-A. Samantala, sa Martes ay pupunta ang aRNO sa DPWH Region IV-A sa opisina nito sa Quezon City upang kuhanan sila ng update at pahayag.'",

It causes a lot of inconvenience to us pedestrians and motorists.

We all know that, when computing or planning for a project, you already put into factor the weather conditions. Philippines experience at least 10 typhoons a year and numerous heavy rains brought about by either monsoon rains or la nina phenomenon. Educated engineers will know this! And yet, Engr Saliganan made this as a pathetic excuse of not meeting his deadline. As we know, when a deadline is not met, it is wasting valuable resources and eventually wasting taxpayer\\'s money! The past months have not been really that wet compared to past years. The rain has been minimal to impact a really well planned and well executed projects. This doesn\\'t seem to be one. I request that a spot check by DPWH Manila inspectors be conducted to ensure these projects have not been compromised and taxpayers\\' money had not been unnecessarily wasted. The concreting of these National project is still allegedly \"ongoing\" and yet we have noticed very few movements of equipments for such projects. Of a grave concern too, is the seemingly substandard quality of concreting of these projects. You can not travel more than 4 kilometres of these \\'new\\' cemented roads without experiencing big cracks and chips on them! Seriously! I urge your good office to please send a Qualified Honest Inspector to spot check these projects before it\\'s too late. Hoping for your positive and quick response. Regards, Tino Nonoy San Jose, Baggao, Cagayan.\nAnd if I may add please. The said project, even though it was promised by Eng\\'r Saliganan that it will be completed by Jan 16, 2016 (2 months late) is still not completed! It\\'s now half way February!'",

This has a tremendous pabigat to everyone because this is the only exit and entry road to and out of Flora and Sta Marcela where hundreds of students have to pass through in order to get to their colleges and schools, and to the merchants and in general the local economy. Rumurs have it that the Gov. Bulut, Jr. of Apayao even offered to the Governor of Cagayan that they complete this as a oint project.

        "body": "Dear Secretary Singson: Magandang Buhay! This is to bring attention to your Office the incidents happening at Mt. Province DEO. Honorable Secretary, you have changed the DPWH image of being corrupt, but in MPDEO still a corrupt agency! The following are part of the practices being done by the Officials at the Agency especially the Chief, Administrative Section: 1. On July 23, 2015, a DPWH loader has fallen along the Talubin-Barlig Road. The operator is a Job Order - Norman Fonite and was in the trip ticket. However, the one who operated it in the time of falling is another Job Order named Samuel Kenept. In the police blotter & local newspaper, the Chief of the Maintenance Section and the inspector reported that a permanent employee in the person of Dencio Comafay was the operator when the loader fell. In fact, Mr. Comafay has an approved trip ticket for the Dump truck to operate at the same roadline at same dates. Due to conscience, Dencio spoke and he said he was pressured by Domingo Pumecha and Janet Valencerina to admit. These two personalities at the MPDEO even falsified the trip tickets, travel orders and the logbooks just to show that it was DENCIO COMAFAY. After sleepless nights and advises this 2nd week of August, Dencio Comafay had his sworn statement to tell the truth. It was also this time that Mr. Pumecha retracted his report at the police when in fact, there was a prior copy of the blotter that was secured. Mr. Pumecha and his men said after thorough investigation it was not Dencio. Mr Secretary, how can that be a thorough investigation when there were falsifications done? 2. WORST SCENARION Mr Secretary is the death of Mr. Arthur Padchonga, a JOB Order worker at MPDEO. Natabunan po siya sa pinapagawang kabiti ng Administrative Officer, Janet A. Valencerina, wife of the Chief of the Construction Division Clifton Valencerina, bagman of the RD at DPWH-CAR. Kasama po ng namtay ang isa ring JO. Nung mag imbsetiga ang pulisya, makikita sa logbook ng DPWH na nabura ang pangalan nila. Sinabi pa ng AO na hindi empleyado dun. Masakit po sa pamilya ni Arthur na araw-araw pumapasok ang ama sa MPDEO, ngayong namatay sinabing di empleyado. Ang pagtanggal ng maraming matagal ng JOs para mapalitan ng kamag-anak, pagdoktor sa publication ang mismong AO position noon at pag bypass sa DE ng DEO... takot lang ang mga empleyado doon na magsalita kasi may pera siya... Ito at marami pang magics ang ginagawa ng AO sa MPDEO. Honorable Secretary, ito ba ang tinatahak ng dpwh na daang matuwid? Sir, lifestyle check din sana.. We hope that the people of Bontoc, employees of DPWH Bontoc be freed from these abusive, corrupt Officals! Copies of the local newspaper and documents that were originally signed by both DPWSH and the JOs will be sent directly to your Office for your reference. These we know especially the contract are now being falsified to show that Padchonga has not been employed thereat. Thank you and mabuhay !'",

People from outside our locality used to say, \"Kapagal na ning dalan yo.\" It means it does not rest because it is not properly done by the local DPWH, it doesn\\'t last longer, one year or two, it deteriorates easily. Last time we spearheaded a signature campaign and submitted the list of concerned citizens to the main office to monitor the construction of the said road,but what happened the complaint went back to the local level, and we agreed with the local dpwh engineers that we will witness the coring. But I was informed with the coring on the day itself 920am and the coring is 930am, leaving us to have no chance to leave our work immediately. So these people were very insincere and acted in bad faith. At present the road is under construction again, in line with the \\'TUWID NA DAAN\" of Pres. Aquino, we would like to implore your good office Sec. Singson to really monitor this road project, to observe the proper PSI, since it is being passed by trucks. As of now we are forced to pass a rough road for rerouting, making our vehicles suffer damages, like our car. We are paying our taxes to enjoy or benefit from the basic services of the government. Is this the price we need to pay? Sec. Singson we know you practice the \"Tuwid na Daan\", but we hope, it will trickle down to your local engineers. We hope you can make it happen.'",

        "body": "Good afternoon, I tried to send this through the feed back page on your website but I kept getting an internal server error. Good afternoon,\n\nI would like to share an event that took place today in Matalom, Leyte about 10:30am January 28, 2015, that involved a construction project site on the national highway. Unfortunately I was involved in vehicular accident on the site of one of your contractors. Fortunately the accident was not very serious (no loss of life) but I believe this could have been avoided. Before entering the area (the stretch of highway where work is being performed) there were no warning signs. I spoke with some of the residents who live in the area and this was a great concern with them as well because there are a number of children in the area. Another issue was the debris on the highway. The gravel left behind on the road is what actually caused my motorcycle tires to lose traction resulting in the accident, a local resident helped me and picked up my motorcycle and moved it out of the traffic lane on the highway. I spoke with several different drivers (PUJ and Tricycle) today and they complained about the same problems. After the accident I called my husband and told him what happened and to come to the scene. After my husband arrived, the driver of one of the trucks placed one yellow warning triangle about two meters behind the trailer of his truck which was parked about 10cm away from the highway lane itself. An action such as this shows the driver of the truck knew he was wrong so he quickly put the warning device out before the manager arrived. A few moments later the manager and his assistant arrived. I must say I was surprised at the way they spoke to me, not only did they start to speak aggressively and loudly at me they also angrily told me how wrong I was about them putting warning signs out for the other drivers on the highway. Not one time did they ask if I was ok or showed any compassion even though I was standing there bruised and bleeding. They treated me as if I was beneath them, not worthy of speaking to them and offended that I dare ask them about warning sings. I called the police to come for my safety because of the hostile behavior of the manager and his assistant with the backing of the construction crew. My husband asked why there were no warning sings placed and why did they not remove the debris from the road, the assistant said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is the Philippines, not America\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I could not believe he said that. I am a Filipina proud of my country and countrymen, his statement suggests that because we are Filipino we are somehow inferior to Americans, as if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to follow rules, I do not share his opinion of my country and my people, I sincerely hope the DPWH who employs this contractor does not share his opinion either. I asked the manager to put warning signs out then he said to me \\xe2\\x80\\x9csee you in court\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as he walked back to his truck. Shortly after the police arrived and I explained what happened. The police officer agreed there should be warning signs in the area for approaching drivers he also mentioned the debris on the road. The police officer asked the manager about the debris (gravel and mud) on the road and he said they did not put it there even though they have the only construction equipment in the area. I drive this stretch of highway two times every day as well as many local drivers, we all say the same thing, the debris from the road is obviously from the construction site, it was not there before they started the work here. After the police spoke to them they agreed to put warning signs on the highway and the assistant manager said to the workers \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmen at work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while laughing and poking his index finger into the palm of his other hand which we know to be an obscene gesture. Today is a day that truly saddened me, to be treated at a level of disrespect that is absolutely unwarranted and unacceptable in any circumstance especially from a company contracted by the DPWH which is a part of the government of the country that I love. I sincerely hope the DPWH does not condone such behavior from its contractors and will take proper steps to ensure their contractors treat our fellow citizens with dignity and respect that we all deserve. Thank you for your assistance and God bless.'",

Esguerra St. in South Triangle,(passing ABS-CBN station area and my condo residence), in Diliman, Quezon City, with some deficiencies and lacking road standards: a)drainage outlets lacking screen/strainer to prevent garbage entering canals, which will be filled-up with debris later since these are not regularly opened and cleaned (also in many drainage canals in metro manila due to their designs. DPWH should consider Malaysian-designed drainage of open rectangular canals covered with folding steel bars for easy cleaning and spotting of water flows/blocking (rather than the current covered culverts). b)road sidewalks for pedestrians are absent in front of certain business establishments (or slanted sidewalk not suited to sidewalk passers but for car parking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not consistent to universal standards as seen abroad); and not continuous due to failure to remove the sidewalk-roadblock (presence of carenderia) near the Megaworld condo building.

PAHATI Construction) In connection with the on-going implementation of the above-subject Project, we would like to bring to your attention the following issues/concerns/complaints in behalf of our community in Camella Homes 5: 1.0 Along the 200-m stretch of Naga Road (from entrance of Dna Julita Subd to the bridge site) which has been dug and installed with new drainage pipes and manholes by R. PAHATI CONSTRUCTION, there is no regular Traffic Management Officer assigned to manage and direct the daily flow of traffic. Likewise, the installed safety barricades/provisions are dangerously inadequate so much so that said stretch of road construction is virtually \\xe2\\x80\\x9can accident waiting to happen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. 2.0 Inadequate installation of visible and informative road signage along Naga Road and in nearby affected roads. Such signs should clearly inform all commuters/affected stakeholders where to enter or pass and if possible, the time/day/period where such restrictions will be in effect; 3.0 Contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negligent work practices in breaking road pavement and excavating the roadway where the drains will be installed has resulted to at least three incidents of Maynilad Water supply mains being busted; 4.0 Information, Education and Communication (IEC) efforts to inform residents of Camella Homes 5 HOA, Dna Paz HOA, Dna Julita HOA, and nearby HOA/communities of the impacts to traffic and pedestrian/vehicle access of the construction activities related to the Project should be extended to all HOA around or near the project site. A public briefing for affected communities could be made soonest at a venue near the project site like in Camella Homes 5 or Vergon Ville covered gym for this matter. (OVER) 5.0 Contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incorrect installation of drainage mains in at least 2 locations (actually observed along Naga Road in front of Camella 5 subdivision) where the existing Maynilad Water supply main line was made to directly intersect and pierce through the concrete drain pipe instead of the Maynilad Water line passing under or over the drainage pipe. This practice is blatant violation of best engineering practice and construction standards. 6.0 The wrong construction method for installation of drainage pipe that allows Maynilad Water supply main to \"pierce\" the concrete pipe - a violation of construction specs & methods for utilities. It is kindly requested that your soonest attention and appropriate measures be effected to resolve issues and problems that persists in the project site. Truly yours, By: ARNOLD P. REYES President, HOAC-5 (Tel. no. 925-7554)'",

With the summer season approaching, one feels the need to have the roads completed.

        "body": "14 January 2016 \n\nThe Secretary Department of Public Works and Highways\n\nDear Sir: This letter concerns a matter of extreme urgency. I am writing to ask your office to look into the project of Congressman Dan Fernandez of the First District of Laguna (who is also planning to run for the position of Mayor of the City of Santa Rosa, Laguna)and to put a halt to it until further investigations and safety checks have been carried out. Mr. Fernandez has embarked on a project to construct a concrete wall on the south riverbank of the Silang-Santa Rosa River, which puts the residents on the riverside at risk of severe flooding and potential collapse and destruction of their houses. This project was planned without consultation with the residents of this city, and construction has been going on for the last month. It was temporarily halted when the river flooded and overflowed on December 19, 2015, and the scaffolding that had already been built for the construction of the wall collapsed and was damaged. Work on the project resumed last week. From the construction workers\\' remarks and seeing the current scaffolding, the height of this planned wall will be higher than the height of the original south riverbank: this, in effect, cuts the width of the river by at least 30% and narrows it considerably. In the event of heavy rain or another typhoon, the volume of water that gets dumped into this river becomes enormous. With the width of the river reduced by 1/3 following construction of the south riverbank concrete wall, the potential for this project to make matters worse has been more than compounded. In the light of the severe flooding throughout the city that happened most recently when the river overflowed above the south riverbank on December 19, 2015,we can foresee that this project will cause the water level to rise above the original riverbank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s height and lead to foreseeable damage and destruction of the homes bordering the north riverbank, and flooding of the roads, especially Gov. Feliciano Gomez St (which parallels the river) and Arambulo and Anonuevo streets (which are perpendicular to Gov. F. Gomez Street). When the flood water level in the river rises above the riverbank and batters the walls of the homes built along the north riverbank, these houses walls will eventually collapse. In our case, the bedroom where my bedridden parents lodge (aged 89 years and 93 years, and incapacitated by multiple strokes) is located right beside the riverbank on the north side. If the floodwaters rise, the water will overflow above the window of their bedroom and flood the bedroom. Evacuating them to a safer place in time of this foreseeable emergency is going to prove to be a challenge for their 2 caregivers. We foresee that the whole house will be inundated with floodwaters following completion of this concrete wall on the opposite side of the river. Our house is sturdily built and has stood on the same site since 1966. Our grandmother\\'s ancestral house was built by our grandfather in 1935 and has withstood 8 decades of typhoons without suffering any damage. They are at high risk of being destroyed as a consequence of Mr. Fernandez\\'s inadequately researched public project. The other homes along the riverbank which lie west and east of our parents\\' and grandparents\\' homes are constructed of more flimsy materials and are much smaller, and bound to take a much harder hit and be more easily damaged or destroyed. Mr. Fernandez newly constructed \"house\"/campaign headquarters lies on the other side of Gov. Feliciano Gomez Street further east, and is constructed on higher ground with high concrete walls, and is unlikely to be at risk of flooding, unlike ours and our neighbors\\' houses. While the reasoning behind this project may have been well-meaning and well-intentioned, the fact remains that this project has been undertaken without the necessary engineering assessments (or maybe, or with utter disregard for them). Construction is currently continuing. There have not been any public announcements nor discussion regarding this project, and no attempt to liaise and inform the residents of the extent and potential consequences of this project have been made. Because of the imminent danger and considerable damage to person and property it threatens to bring, we are therefore asking you to look into this matter urgently and halt construction until a public forum and investigation have been carried out. \n\nVery truly yours, \n\nDr. Melissa Jeanne P. Batilando \nEngr. Emiliano Joel P. Batilando, Jr. \nEngr. Jose Melvyn Glenn P. Batilando \n\nOn behalf of our parents: \n\nEmiliano R. Batilando, Sr. \nGliceria P. Batilando'",

There no signs of attention from DPWH. So I feel that no information was being given by the local officials since most of them are if not truckers owns busses. They may be afraid of having to detour which may cause them additional opex. In any case as a concerned citizen may I know of there are repair/retrofitting or any interim works to avoid pending disaster and loss of life. Thanks and more power.

I know there have been plans of upcoming rehab and we have been seeing this coz houses were already been demolished in preparation for the road widening (i guess?)...but we couldnt endure the worsening road condition and am pretty sure this will worsen as rainy season gets nearer. We really need to see some resolution to this from your department, may it be temporary patching or permanent.

I\\'m at sea for 30 long years and now tired of being away to my family. I\\'m planning to retire in a couple of years. Hope you understand what i mean. I\\'m an owner of two (2) adjacent lots with TCT 116577 and TCT 117138 (5000 M2, now less because of Eco Tourism Road)in Barangay Ibabang Talim, Lucena City, Quezon. At the back of my lot was a creek and a river which is now being quaried. Due to ongoing construction of Eco Tourism Road bridge my lot have been submerged by about 5 meters. This 2 lots were very important to me because this is where i plan my livelihood when i retire in a couple of years. Unfortunately these lots WILL NOT HAVE ANY VALUE BECAUSE IT WAS SUBMERGED BY ABOUT 5 METERS OR MORE ONCE THE BRIDGE ROAD IS FINISHED. I have pictures to prove this. I really concerned about the flooding that always happened in our country and the world due to climate change. I\\'m a living witness to that when typhoon Frank brought flood in that area. Please help me. I hope the goverment will do something about this. Hope this complain will not fall into debt ears. I do believe with Daang Matuwid of the goverment but i also need your assistance into this matter. I do not have the money or resources to level my lot to the bridge. My lot will be a catch basin once the creek and river will overflow. IT IS AT THE CORNER OF FARM TO MARKET ROAD AND ECO TOURISM BRIDGE. Hoping for your favourable reply which is forthcoming. Renato P. Sy Jr. \n\n4-24-15\nDear Sir,\n \nThanks very much for your reply. However gusto ko lang po na malaman kung ano ang plano ng DPWH sa Barangay road. Patataasin po ba ninyo para habulin ang taas ng approach sa tulay or lalagyan nalang ng \"underpass\" para hindi maharangan ang Barangay road sa crossing. Ano din ho ang hakbang para sa anti flood measures.\n \nRespectfully yours,\n \nRenato P. Sy Jr.\n\n5-19-15\nDear Sir/s\n\nThis is a follow up of my previous inquiry of what plan the DPWH is working  with regards to the Barangay Road in Barangay Ibabang Talim which bisects the Morong Bridge Eco Tourism Road in Lucena.\n\nAlso attached herewith is a Petition letter executed and signed by some of the locals in Barangay Ibabang Talim, Lucena City. We have made this letter to show our concern with this project. Hope that you will look into the matter seriously. \n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRenato P. Sy Jr. \n\n6-3-15\nDear Sir,\n\nThanks for the reply.\nFrankly speaking i\\'m not agreeable to this project (uplifting of Ibabang Talim Barangay Road). Underpass for me is the best way to have a safe access in  the Barangay road. Small vehicles motorized/mechanical, bicycle, children, elderly and even farm animals from Barangay Ibabang Talim, BarangaySalinas, Barangay Ransohan, Barangay Ilayang Talim and other adjacent rural Barangays  will use this Underpass as a safest access. I have mentioned it from my previous messages the reasons that we are pointing why we are against the uplifting of Barangay road crossing Morong Bridge. \nYes i have a dialogue with the Project Engineer last March 4 but i did not agree to his proposal. In fact on that same day i have sent my 1st message on the \"Complaint/Feedback form of DPWH. \n\nThey have started pouring stones on the said intersection and we can\\'t do anything right now. As a matter of fact some residents are now restless and loosing hope. Yes we know that this is a goverment project and it\\'s very hard to oppose especially for the rural people/us.\n\nSir, I\\'m leaving the country tonight June 3 to join my ship in Romania and may not always monitor my emails due to limited internet access on the vessel. I will give you the email address of the ship once i\\'m onboard so that you can update me about this matter.The best thing i hope is for this project to address all the needs of the people in the area.\n\nI\\'m expecting all the support the DPWH will extend to me/us so that my lot will not be a catch basin of flood waters and to have good ,safe access to it as well. I hope that despite what happens my lot will still be productive when i retire and not completely loose its value. I\\'m now leaving with these words...\n\n \" HUWAG NAMAN SANA NINYO KAMING IWANAN SA PAGTAHAK SA DAANG MATUWID TUNGO SA KAUNLARAN.\"\n\nRespectfully yours,\nRenato P. Sy Jr.'",

Every year we experience such terrible traffics due to the constant road repairs done by the DPWH and their contractors - surprisingly every year. They have this crazy practice of boring holes on stretches of roads that are supposed to be repaired even as these are still passable. Presumably they do this to immediately collect the mobilization funds even as their construction timetables would take months and even years. Then they start repairing one side of the road there by creating long stretches of one way traffic in mountain highways of bends and curves causing terrible road congestion and unbearable traffic jams that could take even a whole day. This insensitive approach by DPWH and their contractors must change. Regular travelers and motorists and I hope the businessmen as well, from Cagayan Valley should now unite and take a stand from this abuse and lack of concern about the comforts of the commuter. This also takes its toll on the speed of transporting the produce from the Cagayan Valey region which eventually would affect prices of commodities as the transport cost shall be inputted to the final cost of the product when it reaches the market. Moreover it tremendously affects the quality and final price of perishable products like meat and vegetable. KAWAWA NAMAN ANG MGA TAGA CAGAYAN VALLEY. The DPWH need a change of not only its contractors but in strategy! \nPerhaps its time to build a new highway in the Eastern Seaboard of Luzon from Aurora Province to reach Cagayan Valley! This will not only improve traffic flow and transport speed but will also open up huge economic opportunities in the east coast of Isabela and Cagayan provinces. Yung design ng Highway ay dapat cut and fill para straight line siya, in order to make distance and time travel shorter! As much as possible dapat six lanes para walang closed traffic during repairs and reblocking! Our politicians and highway Engineers should visit and learn from Vietnam and Thailand. Those study tours that politicians and government officials often do (for Tourism) should include site visits on infrastructure developments to to see the new highways in other countries They should go and see the Highways from Bangkok to Chiang Mai in Thailand or the highway from Hanoi to Lao Cai and Sapa in Vietnam.

When I called up DPWH-Palawan 3rd Engg District, I was informed it was contracted to \"Lustre Construction\". Our complaint is that these unfinished road sections has been causing tremendous traffic since late last year up to now, especially during rush hour because the widened road seems to have reverted to a one-lane two-way traffic upon reaching these places. What irritates most motorists is that these portions are practically the busiest portions of the urban area part of the national highway in Puerto Princesa City, if not for the entire Province of Palawan. The contractor left these unfinished portions idle and untouched for several months already, proceeding its concreting of the road shoulders instead to the outskirts of the city (rural part). I took photos of these road portions which I can send in PDF format, please furnish me the email address. I hope DPWH can immediately compel the contractor to finish these road sections while the students are still in vacation and the traffic is better off yet and the weather condition is highly favorable.

Now, we cannot pass in our road anymore because the road is impassable. It was too high and no culvert according to my husband since he went to the visit our farm but had to park the car in the roadside. There was even no means for a person to pass, how much more for our 4-wheel vehicle.I talked over the phone with the contractor, Annabi Cagalawan of Cagalawan Enterprises but she said it is not in their scope in the contract. She blamed DPWH personnel who she said is responsible for not looking into the effects of the new road construction to our property road. I am writing this complaint because, I am seeking that our problem be resolved. We were very happy when we knew that the main road was cemented but then we are more sad because we cannot get inside our property anymore. Hoping for your immediate action. \n\nI forgot to put the details of my previous mail. Our property is in Malanang Opol Misamis Oriental. We bought last year a portion of the land from our neighbor for our entrance since our property is in the inner lot. We spent a lot in making the private road so that our car can go downhill to our property. But now, we cannot pass because the road is too high with a canal-like structure (no culvert or cover to the side) which is also dangerous. The contractor - Cagalawan Enterprises said, it is not their concern since it is not part of the scope of their contract. According to her, it was the neglect of DPWH surveyors. Our entrance is almost 3 meters wide facing the mainroad and there are flaglets to distinguish that it is an entrance and there is a private road going down the hill. The private road can easily be seen since the main road is on the higher grounds. Now our property road is impassable. If only there is a connection from the main road to our road by way of covering the \"canal\" so that the vehicles/persons will not fall. Please help us resolve this situation.'",

I really need your help with this.\n\nThe accident happened on 2015 of March 07 Saturday between 12:00 NN \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1:30 PM when we were passing along A. Mendoza St. Sta Cruz Manila.  The construction worker carrying a pail (bucket) on his shoulder  suddenly hit the right side mirror of my vehicle when he  came out from the concrete barrier of the construction site that causes my vehicle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  side mirror broken.  It happened due to the contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negligence and lack of early device warning. \nDuring my inquiry, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that Steven Construction was not prepared and not ready for the safety of their workers and motorists as well. \n\nI am also stating some of our conversation I recalled during the incident and after the admission of their faults.\n\nWhen I stopped and asked the worker why he had to come out from the barrier, he replied back by telling me \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnasaktan na nga po ako eh, puede naman kami lumabas anytime na gusto namen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nI asked him, bakit ka nasaktan when you are carrying a bucket on your shoulder?? Is it proper doing that in your workplace??  \nThe work area and the space provided inside were enough for them to walk through (attached picture) and that made me questioned him of his reasons for coming out from the barrier.   \nHe just walked out and said nothing\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \n\nI asked from other workers the person in-charged of the project because something came up but no one cares from the superiors; even if we had an accident or any discomfort from the worker involved.  \nThen, a person came forward not far from the incident and introduces himself as the Foreman.  \nI asked him about the broken side mirror and the person involved, explained to him their responsibility as a contractor because of negligence and lack of safety devices.\nHe just told me \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckausapin nyo na lang po yung taong nasaktan at pwede naman kami lumabas (from barrier) anytime kasi nagta-trabaho kami dito\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nI was really surprised because he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really know the safety of his people including the by-passers and motorists like us.\nI asked him if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another person in-charged of the project who can handle the situation and he pointed the Engineer who happened to be a few steps away from us.\nThe Foreman walked out and said to my brother \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbayaran nyo na lang kasi ng panggamot para dina kayo maabala pa.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \nThe Engineer on site introduces himself as Engineer Ariel.  My brother asked him about the safety devices like the caution tape and he replied back \\xe2\\x80\\x9csa gabi lang po namin nilalagay Sir\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nWe were shocked and asked him again, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdi ba kayo nagtatrabaho pag araw? Dapat di nyu inaalis and caution tape, dapat ayusin nyo workplace ng site.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nFollowed up by asking him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbakit kulang ang mga safety devices nyo and even the workers walang alam sa safety?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nHe just said  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdi naman po ako nagkulang ng paalala sa tao ko\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and to stop us maybe from  questioning,  he continued by saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnakausap ko na po yun boss ko, sasagutin daw po ang damages at ayusin na lang po natin para matapos na\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nI asked him the name of their company but he refused to give the address, email add and the contact numbers. He said, its in  Ortigas and far from Manila but everyday naman daw sya nasa site and gave me his CP number 0947 601 1907 instead, and promised to pay for the damages because he acknowledges their fault then we left from the site believing that we have a gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agreement.\n\nSo we went directly to Ford Alabang after my appointment in Manila to get the quotation (attached) for the side mirror as I have thought, it will be fixed the same day.  \nThe service advisor told us, that it will be replaced after 3 weeks provided we will pay in advance to ship the item.\nI made a phone call to Engr. Ariel to 0947 601 1907  using my husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CP#0917 824 5869 and he agreed to pay but according to him, he will wait for his boss who has also busy with their project in Bicol and will be here in Manila the following week. \nI told him, the time is important to us because my vehicle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side mirror was broken and needed a replacement the soonest but we have to pay in advance to place the order.\nI told him that this is not what we have agreed while we were in Manila and he started to discuss with me the driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liability and I replied back to him that it would be better if he will talk to my counsel instead of putting all the blame in me.  He told me, may abogado din daw ang kumpanya nila at may pananagutan ako kaya ukey lang daw naman then I told him bakit pa sya nakikipag-ayos sakin if sila ang victim at ako person na may pananagutan. \nHe told me, hindi nya ako bine-blame but nag-explain lang sya sa driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liability dahil nasaktan ang tao nya at nakikipag-ayos na sya dahil may fault din daw sila. Hindi ko man lang daw dinala ang tao nya sa hospital para ipagamot because masakit daw ang shoulder.\nI told him, it was his responsibility because he is the superior and should look after the safety of his people. \nHe told me, he asked the worker to be checked in the hospital but refused to come.\nIf the worker was badly hurt, he cannot standstill and work after the incident.  \nDuring the incident, my 15 year old son approached the worker if he is okey but he just left and ignore my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerned.\nAnother fact, if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responsible enough he may come hurriedly during the time when the accident is happening and not to display his concerned after accepting their faults.\nIf I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask, he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come\\xe2\\x80\\xa6. is that how a responsible superior should be acting??\n\nOur phone conversation that day, ended in the agreement of sending them the amount to be paid to inform his boss.\nI sent him a text message with the amount after the phone conversation using my cp number 0916 323 7224 of March 07 2015.\nOn Monday of March 09 2015,  I was on my way to the nearest police station of where the incident happened I made another call to Engr. Ariel using my cp number 0916 323 7224.\nI also texted him at around 9:30 am and attached with this also my text conversation with him.\nHe did not reply so I went to the station to blotter as per my friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice because it should be done as I am not aware that it has to be filed earlier and I am not familiar to the place.\nI asked the police to help me and visited the site because the Engineer on site started to threaten me.\nThe conversation didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go well when I made a phone call at around 12:30nn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1:30pm if I remember correctly because it was after my class along Recto.\nI asked him, why I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear anything from them and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care the urgency of the situation.\nHe told me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMonday pa lang po at nasa meeting po ako kaya di ako makareply. Wala pa po yun boss, i-update ko po kayo at sigurado po na mag-uusap kayo within this week kasi busy pa po sa Bicol. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\nI told him, how long I will wait when I had my number with him and should he be the one to call me if he cannot decide on the matter??\nHow can I put my mind at ease when he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always waiting for his boss to come in Manila and he just keeps delaying the situation and he refused giving the Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information?\nThen, he told me\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am busy lang po talaga at baka nakakalimutan nyo po na may pananagutan din kayo sa tao namin bilang driver, puede ko nga po kayong ipa-blotter. Di nyu nga po dinala sa ospital yun tao\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\nHe brought back the topic regarding the hospital issue confidently but he never realized how negligent and irresponsible he was.\nI told him, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s free to report the incident and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now threatening me so we will know who violated the rules and as I have mentioned it would be better if our counsels will do the talking since we are both trying to prove innocence of both parties but he ended the conversation that he will send me the updates on how they will settle the broken side mirror.\n \nThey did not coordinate with me since March 09 of 2015.  The police visited the site to investigate but the Foreman said to the officer that we are in the process of coordinating the issue and after the police left the site, the Engineer send me a text as attached dated March 09 2015 but that was the last information I got from them.\nI asked the police officer for the report and picked up the following day March 10, 2015 and forwarded to the Insurance Company supposedly the contractors responsibility.\n\nI am attaching pictures and other documents that you might need for investigation.\nI want to teach them a lesson for their negligence and lack of safety devices that will harm the workers, by-passers, and motorists as well. \n\nHope to hear from you.\n\nThank you,\n\nCriselda M. delos Reyes'",

        "body": "Hi! I just would like to complaint about 2 things, first is the regarding the lights along the EDSA-Ayala Tunnel and same with EDSA-Shaw tunnel. I have noticed that ever since the EDSA-Ayala tunnel was completed, it did not have sufficient lighting inside the tunnel. Same goes with the EDSA-Shaw tunnel, which according to MMDA lights are only turned on during night time. We all know that road safety is everyone's top priority. But in this case I don't think we are putting it on top of our list. Tunnels are really dark in reality, daylight will be very impossible to enter it. That's why we need to install ample lights inside. Motorists should be able to have clear vision inside the tunnel. And should not be required to open their respective head and tail lights. Please install ample lighting in both tunnels since it has been dark for a long time already. For the safety of the motorists passing the tunnel everyday. Secondly, I have noticed that the Philippines has no standard traffic law or traffic signs being used. Why can't we have just one standard law that can be easily understood by the motorist. So everyone is guided by that law. Signages play an important role in the countries traffic system. If we have uniformity in our signages, motorist can easily identify the road rules and regulations. Local Government should follow DPWH laws and not have their own. This adds to the confusion of the motorist. If we have different ordinances in every city. All of us should just use and follow one system. Let me know how I can be of help in solving the long problem of our country. And that is our traffic system. You may contact me thru my mobile phone or e-mail. Thanks and hope to hera from you soon!\"",
