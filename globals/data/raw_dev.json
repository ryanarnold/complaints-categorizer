They just placed on the perimeter of the manhole some concrete barrier (with name as NB). The part of concrete road was done but why is it that they left the manholes uncovered for a long time until now. The uncovered manhole is not safe to all types of vehicles and I noticed that since the manholes are left open the opening are now full of concrete debris and garbage which makes the drainage clogged when rainy season come. This Contractor is very irresponsible from the start up to this time.

Every year we experience such terrible traffics due to the constant road repairs done by the DPWH and their contractors - surprisingly every year. They have this crazy practice of boring holes on stretches of roads that are supposed to be repaired even as these are still passable. Presumably they do this to immediately collect the mobilization funds even as their construction timetables would take months and even years. Then they start repairing one side of the road there by creating long stretches of one way traffic in mountain highways of bends and curves causing terrible road congestion and unbearable traffic jams that could take even a whole day. This insensitive approach by DPWH and their contractors must change. Regular travelers and motorists and I hope the businessmen as well, from Cagayan Valley should now unite and take a stand from this abuse and lack of concern about the comforts of the commuter. This also takes its toll on the speed of transporting the produce from the Cagayan Valey region which eventually would affect prices of commodities as the transport cost shall be inputted to the final cost of the product when it reaches the market. Moreover it tremendously affects the quality and final price of perishable products like meat and vegetable. KAWAWA NAMAN ANG MGA TAGA CAGAYAN VALLEY. The DPWH need a change of not only its contractors but in strategy! \nPerhaps its time to build a new highway in the Eastern Seaboard of Luzon from Aurora Province to reach Cagayan Valley! This will not only improve traffic flow and transport speed but will also open up huge economic opportunities in the east coast of Isabela and Cagayan provinces.

At any time and day, travelers get stuck for an hour or more at the intersection or crossing, which is the choke point. From my point of view, one of the causes of congestion is the number of pedestrians crossing at designated points. Another is the number of vehicles going to and coming from UP Los Banos. Kindly send an investigative team to evaluate and effectively recommend solutions to the problem. Putting up of an elevated pedestrian lane or flyover, among other things, can effectively reduce traffic in Los Banos.

Last time we spearheaded a signature campaign and submitted the list of concerned citizens to the main office to monitor the construction of the said road,but what happened the complaint went back to the local level, and we agreed with the local dpwh engineers that we will witness the coring. But I was informed with the coring on the day itself 920am and the coring is 930am, leaving us to have no chance to leave our work immediately. So these people were very insincere and acted in bad faith. At present the road is under construction again, in line with the \\'TUWID NA DAAN\" of Pres. Aquino, we would like to implore your good office Sec. Singson to really monitor this road project, to observe the proper PSI, since it is being passed by trucks. As of now we are forced to pass a rough road for rerouting, making our vehicles suffer damages, like our car. We are paying our taxes to enjoy or benefit from the basic services of the government.

The following are part of the practices being done by the Officials at the Agency especially the Chief, Administrative Section: 1. On July 23, 2015, a DPWH loader has fallen along the Talubin-Barlig Road. The operator is a Job Order - Norman Fonite and was in the trip ticket. However, the one who operated it in the time of falling is another Job Order named Samuel Kenept. In the police blotter & local newspaper, the Chief of the Maintenance Section and the inspector reported that a permanent employee in the person of Dencio Comafay was the operator when the loader fell. In fact, Mr. Comafay has an approved trip ticket for the Dump truck to operate at the same roadline at same dates. Due to conscience, Dencio spoke and he said he was pressured by Domingo Pumecha and Janet Valencerina to admit. These two personalities at the MPDEO even falsified the trip tickets, travel orders and the logbooks just to show that it was DENCIO COMAFAY. After sleepless nights and advises this 2nd week of August, Dencio Comafay had his sworn statement to tell the truth. It was also this time that Mr. Pumecha retracted his report at the police when in fact, there was a prior copy of the blotter that was secured. Mr. Pumecha and his men said after thorough investigation it was not Dencio. Mr Secretary, how can that be a thorough investigation when there were falsifications done? 2. WORST SCENARION Mr Secretary is the death of Mr. Arthur Padchonga, a JOB Order worker at MPDEO. Natabunan po siya sa pinapagawang kabiti ng Administrative Officer, Janet A. Valencerina, wife of the Chief of the Construction Division Clifton Valencerina, bagman of the RD at DPWH-CAR. Kasama po ng namtay ang isa ring JO. Nung mag imbsetiga ang pulisya, makikita sa logbook ng DPWH na nabura ang pangalan nila. Sinabi pa ng AO na hindi empleyado dun. Masakit po sa pamilya ni Arthur na araw-araw pumapasok ang ama sa MPDEO, ngayong namatay sinabing di empleyado. Ang pagtanggal ng maraming matagal ng JOs para mapalitan ng kamag-anak, pagdoktor sa publication ang mismong AO position noon at pag bypass sa DE ng DEO... takot lang ang mga empleyado doon na magsalita kasi may pera siya... Ito at marami pang magics ang ginagawa ng AO sa MPDEO. Honorable Secretary, ito ba ang tinatahak ng dpwh na daang matuwid? Sir, lifestyle check din sana.. We hope that the people of Bontoc, employees of DPWH Bontoc be freed from these abusive, corrupt Officals! Copies of the local newspaper and documents that were originally signed by both DPWSH and the JOs will be sent directly to your Office for your reference. These we know especially the contract are now being falsified to show that Padchonga has not been employed thereat.

Consider the many Dump trucks and 10 WHEELER TRUCKS that are regularly passing these intersection. Gitgitan lang muli mangyayari dito. I knew our Outgoing Barangay Captain was one of those who made the proposal as a SOLUTION to the terrible traffic in KayTikling.

Look at Rotunda in Capitolyo Pasig, Rotunda Quezon City, Rotunda near NAIA. Rotunda doesnt work well with congested ROADS especially on RUSH HOURS. It may work in other countries with disciplined drivers but not in the Philippines because not all drivers here knows road courtesy.\n\nLet the public know about this Rotunda Project. Kahit nga drawing sa billboard we can tell if it will flow smoothly or not. Widening will ease but Rotunda is a waste of money since Tikling area is small to make a Rotunda, pag itinuloy ang Rotunda, money for Juan I, money for Juan II, will just be many Juans etc...

I really need your help with this.\n\nThe accident happened on 2015 of March 07 Saturday between 12:00 NN \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1:30 PM when we were passing along A. Mendoza St. Sta Cruz Manila.  The construction worker carrying a pail (bucket) on his shoulder  suddenly hit the right side mirror of my vehicle when he  came out from the concrete barrier of the construction site that causes my vehicle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  side mirror broken.  It happened due to the contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negligence and lack of early device warning. \nDuring my inquiry, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that Steven Construction was not prepared and not ready for the safety of their workers and motorists as well. \n\nI am also stating some of our conversation I recalled during the incident and after the admission of their faults.\n\nWhen I stopped and asked the worker why he had to come out from the barrier, he replied back by telling me \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnasaktan na nga po ako eh, puede naman kami lumabas anytime na gusto namen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nI asked him, bakit ka nasaktan when you are carrying a bucket on your shoulder?? Is it proper doing that in your workplace??  \nThe work area and the space provided inside were enough for them to walk through (attached picture) and that made me questioned him of his reasons for coming out from the barrier.   \nHe just walked out and said nothing\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \n\nI asked from other workers the person in-charged of the project because something came up but no one cares from the superiors; even if we had an accident or any discomfort from the worker involved.  \nThen, a person came forward not far from the incident and introduces himself as the Foreman.  \nI asked him about the broken side mirror and the person involved, explained to him their responsibility as a contractor because of negligence and lack of safety devices.\nHe just told me \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckausapin nyo na lang po yung taong nasaktan at pwede naman kami lumabas (from barrier) anytime kasi nagta-trabaho kami dito\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nI was really surprised because he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really know the safety of his people including the by-passers and motorists like us.\nI asked him if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another person in-charged of the project who can handle the situation and he pointed the Engineer who happened to be a few steps away from us.\nThe Foreman walked out and said to my brother \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbayaran nyo na lang kasi ng panggamot para dina kayo maabala pa.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \nThe Engineer on site introduces himself as Engineer Ariel.  My brother asked him about the safety devices like the caution tape and he replied back \\xe2\\x80\\x9csa gabi lang po namin nilalagay Sir\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nWe were shocked and asked him again, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdi ba kayo nagtatrabaho pag araw? Dapat di nyu inaalis and caution tape, dapat ayusin nyo workplace ng site.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nFollowed up by asking him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbakit kulang ang mga safety devices nyo and even the workers walang alam sa safety?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nHe just said  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdi naman po ako nagkulang ng paalala sa tao ko\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and to stop us maybe from  questioning,  he continued by saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnakausap ko na po yun boss ko, sasagutin daw po ang damages at ayusin na lang po natin para matapos na\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\nI asked him the name of their company but he refused to give the address, email add and the contact numbers. He said, its in  Ortigas and far from Manila but everyday naman daw sya nasa site and gave me his CP number 0947 601 1907 instead, and promised to pay for the damages because he acknowledges their fault then we left from the site believing that we have a gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agreement.\n\nSo we went directly to Ford Alabang after my appointment in Manila to get the quotation (attached) for the side mirror as I have thought, it will be fixed the same day.  \nThe service advisor told us, that it will be replaced after 3 weeks provided we will pay in advance to ship the item.\nI made a phone call to Engr. Ariel to 0947 601 1907  using my husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CP#0917 824 5869 and he agreed to pay but according to him, he will wait for his boss who has also busy with their project in Bicol and will be here in Manila the following week. \nI told him, the time is important to us because my vehicle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side mirror was broken and needed a replacement the soonest but we have to pay in advance to place the order.\nI told him that this is not what we have agreed while we were in Manila and he started to discuss with me the driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liability and I replied back to him that it would be better if he will talk to my counsel instead of putting all the blame in me.  He told me, may abogado din daw ang kumpanya nila at may pananagutan ako kaya ukey lang daw naman then I told him bakit pa sya nakikipag-ayos sakin if sila ang victim at ako person na may pananagutan. \nHe told me, hindi nya ako bine-blame but nag-explain lang sya sa driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liability dahil nasaktan ang tao nya at nakikipag-ayos na sya dahil may fault din daw sila. Hindi ko man lang daw dinala ang tao nya sa hospital para ipagamot because masakit daw ang shoulder.\nI told him, it was his responsibility because he is the superior and should look after the safety of his people. \nHe told me, he asked the worker to be checked in the hospital but refused to come.\nIf the worker was badly hurt, he cannot standstill and work after the incident.  \nDuring the incident, my 15 year old son approached the worker if he is okey but he just left and ignore my son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerned.\nAnother fact, if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responsible enough he may come hurriedly during the time when the accident is happening and not to display his concerned after accepting their faults.\nIf I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask, he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come\\xe2\\x80\\xa6. is that how a responsible superior should be acting??\n\nOur phone conversation that day, ended in the agreement of sending them the amount to be paid to inform his boss.\nI sent him a text message with the amount after the phone conversation using my cp number 0916 323 7224 of March 07 2015.\nOn Monday of March 09 2015,  I was on my way to the nearest police station of where the incident happened I made another call to Engr. Ariel using my cp number 0916 323 7224.\nI also texted him at around 9:30 am and attached with this also my text conversation with him.\nHe did not reply so I went to the station to blotter as per my friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice because it should be done as I am not aware that it has to be filed earlier and I am not familiar to the place.\nI asked the police to help me and visited the site because the Engineer on site started to threaten me.\nThe conversation didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go well when I made a phone call at around 12:30nn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1:30pm if I remember correctly because it was after my class along Recto.\nI asked him, why I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear anything from them and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care the urgency of the situation.\nHe told me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMonday pa lang po at nasa meeting po ako kaya di ako makareply. Wala pa po yun boss, i-update ko po kayo at sigurado po na mag-uusap kayo within this week kasi busy pa po sa Bicol. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\nI told him, how long I will wait when I had my number with him and should he be the one to call me if he cannot decide on the matter??\nHow can I put my mind at ease when he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always waiting for his boss to come in Manila and he just keeps delaying the situation and he refused giving the Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information?\nThen, he told me\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am busy lang po talaga at baka nakakalimutan nyo po na may pananagutan din kayo sa tao namin bilang driver, puede ko nga po kayong ipa-blotter. Di nyu nga po dinala sa ospital yun tao\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\nHe brought back the topic regarding the hospital issue confidently but he never realized how negligent and irresponsible he was.\nI told him, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s free to report the incident and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now threatening me so we will know who violated the rules and as I have mentioned it would be better if our counsels will do the talking since we are both trying to prove innocence of both parties but he ended the conversation that he will send me the updates on how they will settle the broken side mirror.\n \nThey did not coordinate with me since March 09 of 2015.  The police visited the site to investigate but the Foreman said to the officer that we are in the process of coordinating the issue and after the police left the site, the Engineer send me a text as attached dated March 09 2015 but that was the last information I got from them.\nI asked the police officer for the report and picked up the following day March 10, 2015 and forwarded to the Insurance Company supposedly the contractors responsibility.\n\nI am attaching pictures and other documents that you might need for investigation.\nI want to teach them a lesson for their negligence and lack of safety devices that will harm the workers, by-passers, and motorists as well. \n\nHope to hear from you.\n\nThank you,\n\nCriselda M. delos Reyes'"}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20151299", "body": "Dear Secretary Singson: Please put a wide pedestrian lane in front of Victoria Plaza Mall and Chowking.at JP Laurel Avenue, Davao City.'"}, {"category": "6", "id": "CFMC-20160326", "body": "DPWH Please check the quality of works of the FC Project in Brgy.Tiaong, Baliuag, Bulacan.

Director:\n\nWith all due respect, I wish to convey my heartfelt thanks for the remarkable improvement that we are now experiencing along the stretch in 20th Avenue at Barangay San Roque, Murphy, Cubao, Quezon City near Bonny Serrano Avenue, the roadway fronting the Camp Aguinaldo grounds.\n\nYears ago, every time we experienced a heavy downpour, the street/pavement fronting our Law Office would be inordinately flooded. In 2009 however, with the fury of Typhoon Ondoy, the ground floor of our Law Office got flooded with one (1) foot, of murky water. After that unfortunate experience of Typhoon Ondoy, we have procured sand bags to serve as improvised and miniature \"barrier-dikes\" to prevent flood waters from seeping into and/or cascading into the ground floor of our Law Office.\n\nI have been informed that an equipment periodically being dispatched by an instrumentality of the government has since been regularly cleaning the drainage lines along the 20th Avenue stretch. Thus, for a long time even with the continuous rains brought about by the recent TWO (2) Habagat downpours, no flooding has occurred in our vicinity. As I am not in my Law Office on a 24/7 basis, and as those people awoke in the wee hours of the morning, who have witnessed the cleaning of the drainage lines cannot say with certainty as to which under your department of the government was it, I surmised that it could either by the MMDA or the DPWH. As I know that it would basically be the DPWH who is actually in charge of this kind of street maintenance works, I feel that it is your Office which has lately attained a reputation of doing remarkable things in an expeditious manner under your stewardship. In the event that I maybe imprecise , I still wish to congratulate you for the good things that you have been doing for the NCR. We are behind you and will fully support you in your various projects for the good of the country. Thank you so much, more power and God bless!\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nWALTER T.

I am a regular biyahero from Manila to Ifugao and vise versa every week as I am working in Manila. Sad to report as a concern citizen that the usual travel of 9 hours from Manila to Ifugao is taking us now almost 18 to 22 hours just because of a very simple re-blocking project of the DPWH from Sta Fe to San Jose. Many Foreigners and some local tourists including me from Banaue and Sagada who missed their international and local flights were so angry because no one from the ground even the policemen passing cannot provide information what is happening with the traffic menace. Drivers from either lane to manila and to the north to Viscaya, Quirino, Isabela, Cagayan, Aparri, Kalinga, Mountain Province and Ifugao are shouting to the foreigners IT IS MORE FUN IN THE PHILIPPINES. MABUHAY ANG DAANG MATUWID!!! With these remarks of disgust from the public, I was so ashamed as a Civil Engineer like you are and this prompted me to search for the DPWH grievance redress mechanism hotline from your website but found your email ad. This are my concerns: i) the traffic everyday at that section if not given attention immediately is next to economic sabotage. The cost of missed flights, office hours, goods undelivered is already enormous than the cost of a very simple re-blocking that did not consider traffic management and its repercussion at all by the contractor and an insensitive regional or district DPWH offices. Imagine, some are already sacrificing to use the Ambuklao road via Baguio just to go to manila because of the mismanagement of the re-blocking that is taking too long. ii) Daang Matuwid and your Unquestionable Integrity and Performance Hon. Singson that regain the respect for DPWH will go down the drain just because of what is now happening to Dalton Pass. iii) Many voters will be disenfranchise for those who will be leaving manila to the provinces and from the provinces to Manila on the night of May 8,2016 because by then they will only arrive home about 6PM of May 9,2016 as what we are experiencing since the latest re-blocking project started. (actual experience today May 1-2,2016 left banaue ifugao at 7 pm on Sunday, reach aritao at 10pm and stranded sta fe until 8Am of Monday and reach manila 6PM of Monday) Suggestions: i) there are several single PCCP blocks that were removed and replaced and are causing one way traffic, can we design this for a 3-7 days concrete and cover these with metal flat sheets so that it can be opened to traffic right away. Further, the shoulder could be widened and improved temporarily as detour. ii) For several short span bridges (about 5) undergoing retrofitting: Why are they not constructed simultaneously and immediately after the steel bars and form works are placed. Again, these can be provided with bypass over the prepared section and or inclusion of detour. For instance, I saw one bridge is finished and what was remaining is the approach connection only but was left undone and it causes one way traffic for several days already, why? Another bridge with in-placed steel bars but not poured. This will go viral in social media am sure in the next few days if no improvement will be made to reduce the inconveniences of the riding public. I would be happy to receive any respond from those staff managing the secretary's affair. Very Truly Yours, Engr. Ericson Mammag\""}, {"category": "4", "id": "CAAC-20130340", "body": "Location: 0236 Wall St., Arce Subd. Kumintang Ibaba, Batangas.\nComplaint: Kanal nabutas, hindi naman tinapos.
