"CAAC-20130008","Subject: Follow-up on Complaint
Good morning USec. Yabut:  Yesterday, I visited the DPWH to follow-up a complaint filed by then Bgy. Capt. Sofronio C. Varona, my father-in-law, re the farm to market road undertaken in Bgy. San Roque, Daram, Samar in 2008 at a cost of P4.7 M. that was tainted by gross anomalies resulting in massive under deliveries of materials & shoddy work. Then DE Jose Balite visited the proj. site with his staff & made a list of corrective work that needed to be done to complete the proj. Not one of these corrective work was done. The undersized pipes are still there as evidence. This complaint was made against Engr. Ruben de los Reyes of your 2nd Samar Engineering Dist. based in Catbalogan, Samar as we found out later that he was the one who actually sub-contracted the work on this proj. We would like to get a copy of the investigation report on this case. Two investigators from the Central Ofc. went to Bgy. San Roque, Daram  but they did not talk to the workers concerned nor to the officials of the Bgy. The Bgy. Capt. was never informed the result of such investigation. On the contrary, despite the complaints against Engr. de los Reyes he has been promoted to Asst. Dist. Engr. It has been many years since these complaints were filed & several letters have been sent to various DPWH & COA officials concerned. We did not get even the courtesy of a response to these letters as required by Civil Service rules. I was advised at your PIO & CIVIC to communicate with you directly on this matter. I hope that, with this e-mail, we will finally get a copy of the investigation report on this complaint. Thank you. We look forward to hearing soon from USec. Yabut as we were told that CIVIC has no record of this complaint.","2013-01-07 08:42:59","5",NULL

Sir, With regards to your email message, according to CAR Director Edilberto P. Carabbacan, they already requested priority funding for the Balili (Bontoc)-Suyo-Ambasing (Sagada) local road which connects to the Dantay-Sagada Road. 
Further, DOT-DAR Regional Director Purificacion S. Suanding-Molintas in her letter dated 14 December 2012 to CAR Regional Director Carabbacan, said that originally, the programmed Sabangan-Sagada Road project, which is to be funded from the DOT-DPWH CY 2013 Convergence Project amounting to P100 Million, has passed the Tourism Road Infrastructure Project Prioritization Criteria (TRIPPC) and has likewise been validated by a composite team from NEDA, DPWH and Mountain Province Provincial Tourism Office (please see attached copy).

I will try to gather some statements from other residents if they really have no objection on the damages to their structures and will inform you of the outcome. 
Sincerely yours, 
Relative to your concern, Region V Director Danilo Dequito submitted his reply with the following information:
•         The Rehabilitation/Reconstruction/Upgrading of Damaged Paved National roads of Ariman-Jct. Bulusan Lake Road Project (Sta. 620+874 to Sta. 627+900 with exception) was implemented in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, with the inclusion of the “open canal”.
•         During  the dialogue before the prosecution of the project,  residents of Bulusan did not raise any  opposition/objection on the demolition of their fences and other structures, and they even committed to voluntarily removed obstructions without any cost from the government
•         Sangguniang Bayan Members of Bulusan were given updates on the status of the project and were enlightened on the construction of open/line canal along the concrete road during their 1st regular session
 
Further, Director Dequito  said that he will instruct Sorsogon 2nd DEO to include the “covering of the lined canal” in their list of priority projects for future funding.
Should you have any other concern, please don’t hesitate to inform us.
Thank you and kind regards.

Part of road widening was done at the town proper of Bulusan.  Our town is a 4th class municipality and mostly of the residents live below poverty.  If something happen to them caused by this open canal, who will be responsible?  
Is there any action being taken by the Regional and/or District Office? Will the contractor be able to cover the canal?

Dear Sir, 
Mabuhay po!
May itatanong lang po. 
Ako po ay isang residente ng Bulusan, Sorsogon. Sa ngayon po ay may ginagawa kayong road widening sa lugar namin dito mismo sa bayan ng Bulusan, Sorsogon.  Kasama sa ginawa ay ang ""open canal"" sa magkabilang gilid ng kalsada. Maraming naapektuhan na kabahayan na kailangan gibain ang harapang bahagi ng kanilang bahay at bakod. Alam ng lahat na wala silang magagawa dahil ito ay proyekto ng gobyerno na kailangan kahit na napinsala ang bahagi ng bahay nila. 
Base po sa aking obserbasyon, ang ""open canal"" na ito ay napakadelikado kung hindi matatakpan dahil ito po ay may kalaliman at nasa gilid mismo ng mga bahay-bahay. Noong matapos gawin ang kalsada at canal, yung mga residente na naapektuhan ay nagkanya-kanya na ding gumawa ng maliit na daanan (access) papasok sa kanilang bakuran. Ito po bang access ay hindi kasama sa scope ng kontratista? Ito po bang open canal ay hindi na tatakpan? 
Sana po isaalang-alang po ninyo unang-una sa lahat ang kaligtasan ng mga mamamayan.  Huwag na po ninyong antayin na may sakuna na mangyari bago matakpan an canal na ito. 
May ikinabit po akong litrato ng kalsada para po sa inyo.
Maraming salamat po ngayon pa lang sa aksyon na gagawin niyo.

This year the Municipality of Naawan is recipient of the Tulay ng Pangulo which is erected at Barangay Tagbalogo and Mat-I of this municipality. The said Tulay ng Pangulo project has indeed improved the lives of our people by boosting the economic activity of the nearby barangays.

The people of Naawan are satisfied with the newly constructed bridge and we pray that here will be more of Tulay ng Pangulo in the municipality. At present we still have rivers that separate us from other residents and that needs bridge to connect us.

Mahal na Pangulong Aquino,
 
                Ako po si Julius Irvin O. Mariano, dalawampu’t isang taong gulang, tubong Pampanga. Ang mga magulang ko po ay sina July P. Mariano at Emily O. Mariano. Ang aking ama po ay kasalukuyang namamasukan sa DPWH bilang Job Order sa posisyong Project Evaluation Officer, mahigit sa labingwalong taon na po siya sa kagawaran, dati po siyang casual employee subalit dahil po sa rationalization plan ng gobyerno ay napilitan po siyang tumanggap ng isang Job Order na posisyon. Ang aking ina naman po ay mahigit dalawampung taon ng guro sa pampublikong paaralan ng Siran Guagua, Pampanga. May isa po akong kapatid na nagngangalang Jem, siya po ay walong taong gulang pa lamang. 
 Hindi po naging biro ang naging karanasan ko noong ako’y nag aaral pa dahil po bago ako mag umpisa sa kolehiyo ay nagkaroon ng Nasopharyngeal Cancer ang aking ama, naging mahirap po ang naging pakikipaglaban ng aking ama sa sakit na ito subalit po sa pagnanais pa niyang mabuhay para sa aming kanyang pamilya at sa awa’t biyaya ng Diyos ay kaniyang napagtagumpayan ito. Subalit ang kanyang naging sakit ay nag iwan ng isang impairment sa kanyang kakayanang kumain ng normal. Sa kalagitnaan po ng kanyang treatment ay kinailangan syang lagyan ng Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube upang siya po ay makakain. Mag aanim na taon na pong ganito ang kalagayan ni daddy subalit nagsikap pa rin po siyang makabalik sa trabaho dahil alam niya na hindi kaya ng sahod ng aming ina ang mga pangangailangan ng aming pamilya. Nagsilbi po itong inspirasyon para sa akin upang aking pagbutihan ang aking naging pag aaral, sa mga iilang pagkakataon po ay naging Academic Achiever po ako at nakita ko po ang tuwa sa kanila, naging masaya rin po ako dahil napapakita ko sa kanila na kahit papaano ay hindi nasasayang ang kanilang mga paghihirap para sa akin, lalo na po hindi biro ang magpaaral sa pribadong unibersidad sa panahon ngayon.  Pinangarap ko pong makapagtapos sa lalong madaling panahon nang sa gayon ay matulungan ko po ang aking mga magulang at magantihan po ang naging maraming pagsasakripisyo po nila. Nakapagtapos po ako ng kursong Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communications Engineering, Abril ng nakaraang taon at sa awa po ng Panginoong Diyos ay napasa ko po ang board exam noong October 2012. Napakasaya ko po noong napasa ko ang board dahil muli ay nakita ko sa aking mga magulang ang tuwa, higit lalo po ay ang lisensyang nakamit ko ay magiging malaking tulong sa paghahanap ko po ng magandang trabaho.
Napag alaman ko pong mayroong hiring sa DPWH Pampanga Second Engineering District para sa posisyong Computer Maintenance Technologist, dali dali po akong nag apply at nagsumite ng mga kailangang dokumento noong ika-14 ng Enero ngayong taon. Naging maganda po ang pagtanggap ng staff ng opisina, mula po sa District Engineer na si Engr. Juanito V. Reguyal hanggang sa Chief po ng Administrative Division na si Mrs. Jennifer Gonzales. Positibo po ang kanilang naging feedback sa aking application at sa kanilang naging evaluation po na ipinasa sa Regional Office ay ako ang kanila piniling inomina para sa posisyon. Noong ika-4 ng Pebrero ay kanila na nila akong pinapasok upang maumpisahan na ang aking training. Kahapon po, ika-5 ng Pebrero ay ginawa na nila ang resolution para gawin ng opisyal ang kanilang magiging pagkuha sa akin bilang empleyado, personal ko pong inihatid ito sa Regional Office upang sa ganoon ay mapirmahan na ng mga kinauukulan. Sinabihan po akong iwan na lamang ang mga dokumento at bumalik na sa District Office dahil ipapa deliver na lamang daw po. Naging hopeful po ako dahil pagkatapos mapirmahan ng resolution ay appointment na lamang po ang aking hihintayin at opisyal na akong makakapag umpisa sa trabaho. Ngunit biglang sinabihan po ako kanina na ayaw daw pong pirmahan ang aking resolution ng mga kinauukulan dahil mayroon daw pong ibang ilalagay dun sa posisyong inapplyan ko sa kabila ng rekomendasyon mula sa District Office. Nalaman ko pong pamangkin ng Construction Division Chief na si Engr. Lucito O. Sibug ang ibang aplikante. Nang malaman po ng Administrative Staff ng District Office ang balitang ito ay nagulat din sila dahil umaasa silang ang kanilang naging rekomendasyon ay aayunan ng Regional Director, Asst. Regional Director at iba pang kinauukulan.  Dismayado po sila dahil parang hindi iginalang ng mga kinauukulan ang kanilang naging desisyon, na parang nabalewala daw po sila sa nangyari. 
Ang nais ko po sana ay mabigyan ako ng kasagutan ukol sa totoong nangyari, sa naging evaluation po ng qualifications naming dalawang aplikante ay ako ang nanalo, ako ang inendorso ng opisinang nangangailangan ng empleyado. Nakisalamuha at nagtraining na po ako sa opisina. Naging maaga po ako sa pagpasok sa naging training ko at sumunod sa lahat ng utos at patakaran ng opisina sa pagnanais pong magkaroon ng good impression sa akin ang mga ibang empleyado doon. Sinabihan po ako ng District Engineer ng personal na mas gusto niya ako para doon sa posisyon. Noong pirma na lamang po ng mga nasa posisyon ang kailangan para maging opisyal na akong empleyado, doon pa ako inilaglag? Ganoon po ba talaga ang patakaran sa gobyerno natin? Ganoon po ba ang sistema? Na nadadaig ng “kamag anak at kakilala” ang magandang qualifications at magandang educational background? Hindi po sa nais kong siraan ang aking kalaban sa posisyon subalit ang sabi po sa akin ay isa po siyang Computer Science graduate, isang apat na taong kurso na kanyang tinapos sa loob ng pitong taon. Hindi po ako nanghahamak o nagmamalaki, sinasabi ko lamang po ang katotohanan na aking narining. Hindi po ba’t ang totoong purpose ng rationalization plan ay upang masiguradong lahat ng mga nanunungkulan sa gobyerno ay kwalipikado para sa posisyong hawak niya? Ganito po ba talaga?
Kami po ay simpleng pamilya lamang, hindi mayaman at walang kakilalang maimpluwensiyang tao. Walang masasandalan kapag kami po ginipit ng mga maimpluwensiyang tao. Pero naniniwala pa rin po ako sa inyong mga adhikain Mahal na Pangulo, na pantay pantay ang turing sa bawat Pilipino. Parehong oportunidad para sa mga tao regardless sa kung sino ang kamag anak o kabigan nila. Sana po ay sa sa aking munting paraan ay mapaabot ko po sa inyo ang aking naging karanasan. Maraming salamat po.

Dear Secretary,
A pleasant day to you sir,I know that you're always busy but i hope you will find time to read my e-mail to you which i believe will be beneficial to all concern.
We're temporary relieved to hear that the remedial course/exam was indefinitely postponed for reasons that only the ManCom knows,This remedial course/exam in the first place is inappropriate but just to cater favored few who were protegees of the ManCom members.The criteria set by the ManCom was deliberately made to qualify the son of a certain Undersecretary and personnel of region 02 who were all protegees of a former director who is now a member of the ManCom,please take note that those who qualified to take these remedial exam came from that region while nobody from other regions qualifies.Sir we believe in your sincerity in instigating reform in this Department but the very same men around you are the ones tarnishing the image of the dept.You cannot instill to us the core values like transparency,integrity, professionalism if the ManCom itself do not have these values.Some of these leaders of ours are former Dist engineers,Directors who were noted to have dubious records before they become Undersecretaries & Asst Secretaries and now have the powers to manipulate laws/dept orders,I therefore appeal to you dear Secretary to uphold your original decision that if we fail in the promotional exam then we'll have to take it again but not through short cut method crafted by the ManCom which their main purpose is to accommodate their favored protegees. We challenge you Sir to once & for all eradicate these malpractices made by your staff whom you believe doing right but otherwise,for the sake of equality to all personnel of the DPWH.

Road Repaired After 13 Years Except For Worst Part (sender: Fred Diestelkamp, email : diestelkamp_j@yahoo.com) – I want to call the attention of the concerned authorities to the Barili-Dumanjug road in South Cebu. This road (after 13 years) was finally repaired and surfaced in 2012, except for the last three kilometres or thereabout going toward the Dumanjug boundary. Pocked with so many potholes, this stretch is the worst road part of the road, and yet this seems to have been deliberately neglected. Question: Why?

Sorry, but I and many people here in south Cebu are more than fed up with the ""Road Maintenance Program"" of the Department of Public Works and Highways! We, taxpayers, have to make additional expenses for new tires, shock absorbers and time-consuming vulcanizing of punctured tires, etc. Yet, just 10 meters away, in the second district (Dumanjug), the national road has been twice ot thrice tarmacked (in 2011 and 2013), though in all instances the so-called maintenance work was absolutely unnecessary. 

What a mess and lack of organization! Or is this again an offshoot of the usual game that local political dynasties/syndicates play out before elections?

The Last Mohican by Mario Fetalino Jr. – Dapat siguro ay si Las Piñas Mayor Nene Aguilar and kalampagin natin tungkol sa peligrosong construction work na ginawa ng DPWH sa Aguilar Avenue.
Hanggang ngayon ay bukol-bukol pa rin ang dating pantay na kalyedahil sa mga nakausling tapal na inilagay ng DPWH sa mga hinukay nito. 

Nagbibingi-bingihan naman itong si DPWH Sec. Rogelio Singsontungkol sa kapalpakan na ginawa ng kanyang ahensiya na may ambisyon pang i-rehab ang EDSA!!!

Aguilar Avenue nga hindi mo maasikaso ng matino, EDSA pa, Sec. Singson?

Aba mayor, katulad mo ba si Singson na mag aantay pa ng disgrasya sa Aguilar Avenue na sakop ng siyudad mo bago kayo umaksiyon?

Hindi na maayos ni Aguilar ang bwisit na trapik sa Las Piñas partikular sa Alabang-Zapote Road dahil sa dami ng mga mall ni Henry Sy na pinayagan ng City Hall na magsitayuan sa siyudad kaya baka naman pwedeng kahit ito na lang problema sa Aguliar Avenue ang kanyang pagtuunan ng pansin.

Hindi ka ba nababadtrip meyor sa DPWH dahil sinira nito ang magagandang lansangan na nakapangalan sa'yo?

Pasyalan mo naman meyor ang dating pantay na Aguilar Avenue para makita mo kung paano ito nilapastangan ng DPWH ni Singson.

Kung may madisgrasya sa Aguilar Avenue dahil sa kapabayaan n'yo meyor at ni Singson, matutuwa ang maraming tao kung pag-uuntugin ang ulo nyo.

Dear Sec. Singson;
Once again, we bid you greetings from Cebu!
After the moratorium on the construction of flyovers planned for Cebu City, the Movement for a livable Cebu (MLC) had the opportunity to shift focus and rallied our limited resources towards the advocacy for comprehensive planning, and participating in various efforts that contribute to making and ensuring a livable Cebu. However, this new focus was suddenly disturbed last October 15 by the unexpected insistence by Citizen Raul Del Mar in the Cebu City Development Council (CCDC) quarterly meeting to revive the flyover projects once again. 
His rationale for adding this item on the CCDC's agenda for the day was the fact that he had signatures from 49 Barangay captains asking for reconsideration of the previously ""dropped"" flyover projects in an earlier CCDC meeting, notwithstanding the fact that the said flyovers are not in their Barangays. Furthermore, please note that since that meeting, there have been nodevelopments technically or otherwise that would warrant reconsideration. In addition, we have seen no efforts by Citizen Del Mar that led to his various constituents to reversing their earlier anti-flyover sentiments. 
We find it disturbing that despite results that showed the ineffectiveness of flyovers at specific junctions, the continuing moratorium your department has imposed, the decisions of the CCDC and the city government which dropped the flyover projects and the clamor from the population for projects that the city needs immediately (like flood control, livelihood projects, housing, medical care, etc.), citizen Del Mar keeps on insisting in pushing his agenda. 
We are happy that the CCDC did not flinch and include the flyover issue in the last meeting’s agenda. However, this will once again be included in the next meeting scheduled for around the beginning of December.
We are grateful for your continuing moratorium on flyover construction until the proper studies and consultations have been made. We have not made it a secret that we at MLC would only consider the flyover alternative (among others) if it is a part of the comprehensive development plan that we so need right now.  
Please accept our gratitude and appreciation for your listening to all stakeholders including civil society, and for your firm conviction of proceeding only after thorough technical analysis, comprehensive consultation and respect for the laws of the land.
Gob bless you and your staff.

Very truly yours,

"CAAC-20130363","Greetings!

I was wondering if you can do anything to the Batasan/Commonwealth underpass? It's good that they overlaid asphalt throughout the whole underpass. However, as a result, the road became a bit elevated, with the 2 steel gratings used for drainage remaining at the same level. Vehicles passing this road have to slow down as this caused a deep depression on the road, and running over these will damage vehicles in the long run. 

May I request you to elevate these steel gratings in order for vehicles to pass through smoothly again? Your response and action will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

P.S. I have attached a picture of one of the gratings to give you an idea. Please zoom in to get a clearer picture.

Fax. No: 304-3020
Manila

Dear Secretary Singson,

I am writing (a) to call your attention to a defective DPWH-funded Mapandan Creek gravity wall constructed at our village here in San Juan, Cainta, Rizal, and (b) to request your good office to send your Bureau of Design, or whichever appropriate bureau, to inspect and verify if the said construction conforms to the design standards and if it fully complies with the specifications approved for funding. 

The subject project is under the code 4A0612F00044 as shown on the DPWH website. 

To be fair to the Department and to the PMO as the implementing agency, the construction started on time on the first week of January 2013. As of this writing, the work is roughly 50% “complete” as far as our village is concerned.

However, on February 22, a Friday, after a three- to four-hour light rain that lasted until past 12:00 noon, the water at the creek rose by about 1.5 meters. As a result, several homes were affected, as well as our backyard, by strong water leaks coming from the newly built gravity walls. A neighbor described a faucet-like leak. A block away, residents had to scramble for safety as the gravity wall at the back of their house nearly collapsed, causing the water from the creek to flood the streets. (Attached here are photos of the breached gravity wall of a property along Swimming St).

When workers were piling up rocks at the back of our property, I noticed that they only poured grout after every two-feet interval. A PMO supervisor who visited us on the same day I called—February 25—told me that grouting should be at every 30 cm, or a little above 11 inches of intervals, which is confirmed also by a DPWH engineer from the 1st District of Rizal who I consulted. Another non-compliance to the plan is the use of single layer gabion. The contractor told me that a double-layer gabion is only appropriate to open properties with no structures that may be potentially affected or damaged.

On February 25, after inspecting our property, I brought the PMO people and the contractor to our Homeowners Association office to discuss with the officers and the affected homeowners possible remedies to our problem. And while the contractor promised to do whatever is necessary, I personally feel that our situation should be brought to your attention for proper cause of action, especially when the contractor could not assure us if a “palitada” could even plug the leaks and if it can withstand impact and constant battering of water most especially during the storm season. 

The poor quality of construction, I would like to believe, may not entirely be the contractor’s fault as he may just be following what I suspect is a flawed design, and for which I am requesting your Bureau of Design or the most appropriate agency to verify. 

Our lives, more than our property, are at stake here. 

After Ondoy in September 2009 and the Habagat in August 2012, we could no longer afford to live under a constant threat of another flood. While we are thankful that finally our village will be spared from flooding, which is getting worse in recent years, we are dismayed, to say the least, that the construction of the gravity may never grant us the peace of mind that we have been waiting for a long time. We are wrong!

But what is more serious to me, and to all of us, is the seeming deliberate attempt of some people to shortchange the government by giving us constituents an infrastructure that is designed to fail.

Together with my fellow villagers, I am hoping for your immediate action.

mahal na sekretary singson

Pwede po bang paki check nyo po itong dirietor ng Internal Audit na naglilibot sa pilipinas para puntahan ang mga internal auditor nya. sa paguusap namin ng mga tag field office ay halos palagi ito siya nasa field wala po ba itong ibang trabaho kundi maglibot sa pilipinas. noon isinulat po sa iyo itong pinaggagawa ng director na ito sa field ngunit hindi dar ito nakarating sa iyo dahil marami po daw itong mga kasangga diya pati daw po sa offcie ninyo. san po ay makarating ito sa iyo dahil masama na po ang ginagawa niya. gaya ng natutulog siya pagkatapos mag salit sa last day ng audit na parang tinatakot ang mga district engineer. syempre ang aming mga boss ay natatkot baka mapalitan siladahil sa mga makikita ng mga auditor nya. ang mga boss namin ay nag cocollect nga pera para ibigay daw sa director na ito at mga auditor para hindi na mareport ang mag gawaing hindi tama ng office. Ang mga aiditor po niya ay nahawa na rin sa mga gawain nya. mamumutiktik po ito siya ng pasalobong dahil pag walang sobre at pasalubong irereport ang mga maling gawain ng office.

Itong director na ito ay gusto titira sa mga hotel may kasama pa siyang alalay. syempre pakakinin po sila ng mga boss namin. ang problema ay kung saan kukunin ang perang pang gastos. kahit noong kagagling lang niya sa st luke global dahit po bigla siyang natumba at nabaguk ang ulo ay naglilibot pa rin ito na naka wheel chair.
sana po ay macontrol nyo ang director na ito dahit hindi siya magandang halimbawa. ang tinnatahak po niya ay baloktot na daan parin. kung nag tatalo na po ang auditro at inaudit dahil sa mga ginagawa nito nakatanga lang po itong director pag gising siya dahil siguro wala naman siyang alam tunkol sa audit. 

maramin pa po kaming ibubunyag sa mga gawain ng director na ito peru pangunang salvo palang ito. san po ay makarating ito sa iyo para maimbestigahan siya sa kanyang mga hindi magandang gawain

Good afternoon, Beth.

Sorry to disturb your lunch break.  I've been wanting to send you an email about something, it's just that when I get to the office and do my daily work, I forget about it.

It's just a blessing that I saw this email from you and I remembered.

Don't want to sound like I'm complaining but this matter bothers me everytime I pass by the area while commuting to and from work daily.  Actually, it's the uncemented road portion along the Litex-Payatas Road.  Coming from Rodriguez (Montalban), Rizal, the uncemented span is before the Km 25 QC marker and probably within or after the Km 24 portion, though I wasn't able to see a marker with the Km 24 QC sign.

Most portions of the Litex-Payatas Road average 4 lanes - 2 lanes on each side (going and coming).  However, due to the uncemented portion, that span there only has 2 lanes used by vehicles traversing the area as the uncemented portion is used as parking space by garbage trucks and other vehicles probably of nearby residents.  At certain times, this portion becomes the bottleneck during rush hours and there is heavy traffic.

Also, with the occasional rains happening the past days, the road area near the GK Village there, particularly the one sloping down is flooded with rainwater and takes some time for the water to subside.  If heavy rains persist for several days, the area is not passable for small/ light vehicles.  There obviously is a problem with drainage in the area.

Hope these concerns can be checked and the proper remedies can be done.

Thank you for your attention on the matter.

Have a meaningful Holy Week!  God bless everyone!

Rosan

The DPWH is one of the pilot government agencies subjected to performance governance system adapting the Balanced Score Card rating.
          The award called, Trailblazer Award, is given to participating agencies or units in the public revalida based on significant progress in the agency¡¦s initiatives and scorecard. Last year, the DPWH has also received the ¡§Governance Excellence Seal,¡¨  again the highest rating among participating government agencies, for its outstanding progress under its good governance program and an unwavering commitment to reform in the Philippine public sector.

          Secretary Singson reported on the DPWH performance on paving and upgrading of national roads, construction of permanent bridges, implementation of major flood control projects on major river basins, and other significant gains in its good governance and anti-corruption reforms under the ¡§Daang Matuwid¡¨ policy agenda of the Aquino Administration.
          In his message, Secretary Singson ¡§firmly believes that while the DPWH continues to transform itself into a results-based government agency under a new era of good governance, the agency never wavered from its focus of delivering the right infrastructure needed to sustain the country¡¦s economic development.¡¨

Mr. President;

I've been a frequent traveler to Cagayan, Ilocos, La Union, and Bicol these past years and the situation never changes. The highways are always populated by palay being dried, kuligligs, and tricycles. There was even a trip I took to Bulacan where vehicles are forced by barangay traffic enforcers to go through one lane with traffic being alternated because a whole stretch of one lane of the road was full of workers sifting through the palay.

The DPWH should do more than plead: they should impose. They should use the powers of the police to enforce the existing laws about obstruction and the like. Heck, the DPWH should work with the DILG and fine and sanction LGUs who cannot enforce order in their respective jurisdictions regarding this issue.

Also, I thought people in the provinces are supposed to be more polite and more considerate compared to those from Manila. Yet, common road courtesy seems to be non-existent in the province! 

Imagine coasting along at a good 60-70 kph going to Ilocos. You then come across a tricycle doing 25 kph. You try to overtake but can't because of the continuous traffic on the opposite lane as well as many lanes occupied by drying palay and cordoned off with large rocks. You honk your horn politely to signal the tricycle if it could move over to the right a little bit towards the shoulder so you can overtake safely and be on your way. Imagine seeing the tricycle driver (usually a young lad in his teens) look back at you and then look forward and act as if you don't exist and ignore your ""excuse me may I pass please"" honk. Imagine this goes on for the next 3-4 kilometers before you finally get a safe chance to overtake. Imagine this get repeated on the same trip dozens of times. 

I suppose it is easy to justify why motorists have come to have such low regard for these undisciplined blokes.

Mr. President panahon na po para itigil ang kultura ng pagbibilad ng palay sa mga daan dahil ilang buhay na ang nasayang, wag na po nating hintayin pang madagdagan pa ang masasayang na buhay.

Subject: asphalt laying at F.P. Felix avenue
Sir/Ma’am,
I would like to inquire if the asphalt laying at F.P. Felix Ave. (formerly Imelda Avenue) is still with in standards of the curb and gutter designs. It can be observed that the road height increased by 4 inches to 10 inches after the asphalt laying done by the contractor. Some of the asphalted road is even higher than the concrete gutter. The gap between the asphalted road and the concrete gutter is a dangerous part of the road for some bicycle riders,  motorcycle riders and even for some cars. 
Hoping for your prompt reply regarding this matter.
 
Thank you very much,

"CAAC-20130599","ANOTHER GOVT AGENCY PROVES THINGS CAN WORK! CONGRATS DPWH!:

For a while we were planning to take a trip to Hamilo and wanted to know if the new road that passes through Ternate was open. FYI: the new Ternate road allows you to get to the northern Batanggas (nasugbu, Tali, Punta Fuego, etcetc) beaches in HALF the time. Anyway, we texted the DPWH text hotline with LOW expectations. We got a quick response on the status of the roadwork and even a phone number of the engineer in charge.

We then contacted the office, suprisingly the phone was picked up quickly and we were directed to maintenance for the information. Of course maintenance was the wrong office because technically the road was still under contruction. Small mistake. We were immediately redirected to the right office and even given the actual status of the roadwork. We were also advised on the hours this road was open ( before 7am and after 5pm to accomodate the ongoing finishing of the project).

We give DPWH a hard time becasue theyre one of the more visible agencies that tend to inconvenience us in the process of their service. In this case, lets congratulate their INVISIBLE service that helps us get around much faster. Oh and lets not forget the staff and engineers who took our calls and sounded genuinely pleasant while helping us out.

We need you to get your act together! When are guys going to stop giving us, commuters, a hard time?

The works for the road rehabilitation and installation of canal drainage along Maharlika highway from Sto Tomas to San Pablo has started so many years back. The portion along Alaminos to San Pablo being intensified back in early 2010 on an ""on & off"" basis and at all times have been causing terrible traffic. 

Now a week before Holy Week, DPWH had started works again (see attached). Are you guys not capable of thinking? At the time where people are going home for the long holidays? Are you intentionally inflicting discomfort to people? Aren't you guys capable of even thinking for other peoples' goodness and well being? Come on? You are entitled to grow that little part of brain capable to think of what is right.

Another issue you may want to look into is the quality of materials that your contractors are using. Time and this just keeps going on in full circle. After doing the repair one night of continuous rain will result to damage road again the following day. Then another repair, will be undertaken by laying asphalt so that the existing road would result to an increase of another inch or two in height. If this would continue in just a couple of years, the road will be higher than the houses along the highway. Don't you have a STANDARD road height/thickness that you follow? A non-engineer knows this. How come you don't?!","2013-04-10 16:59:36","4",NULL

Take note, effective March 1, 2013. 

My concern is this memorandum from the said district (Albay District Eng'g office) contradicts/violates the memo from the central office regarding the RENEWAL OF CONTRACTUAL/CASUAL/JOB ORDER EMPLOYEES. Does your good office thinks this is LAWFUL - terminating the casual employees?

This part of the national road, ever since it was rehabilitated has been a frequent site of accidents. Drivers and the residents observed that the road has become too slippery and shiny, in fact some would say that the road now looks like an ordinary house floor.

We hope it can be remedied immediately especially that it is a major highway connecting the northern and southern part of Ilocos Sur.

My thing is its our land and my parents pay for it they build our house with our own money and now government wants to claim the land we are paying tax every year and its not really fair
They said its about tourism and shit! Its good they think about improvement in my place but on tge other hand its not fair what they want to do
Ok. You guys will do still road widening for development and as what the engr. Says its for everyones best interest but is that safe specially I have 3 nieces that one we open our door its already road?

That project is really shitty!!! I found it unfair and bullshit! Probably all the person in positions are corrupt and they are all after for money that they can get on this project!
And one more thing I dunno who give the letter to my grandma and grandpa and they said its not really road widening and they didnt really explain whats the letter all about so my poor grandparents sign it.

Dear Ms Pilorin and Dir Dequito, 

I have another concern on the road widening in Bulusan. There were portions of hills along the roadside affected by the road widening.  My concern is that the affected cut area might erode. This affected area is just at the upper level of the town proper.  I have  attach some photos for your info. 
I need an assurance from your good office that the affected areas will be given proper streetscaping for safety as I believe It is best to take an early prevention measure. 
Thank you for your action.

This interruption has tremendously affected our business, and the economic impact is akin to that of feeling in agony because of your project. We ask you therefore to please fix this problem as soon as possible and help us earn a good living , so we as law abiding citizens can empathize and work for the common good of the Filipinos.

I wish to congratulate your Chief Information officer, Ms. Elizabeth Pilorin, who tirelessly assisted our fB group, Pagsanjan Freedom of Expression (aka PFoE) in getting updated information on the status of construction and completion of the Pagsanjan Bridge also known as Balanak Bridge  (along the Luisiana - Lucban-Pagsanjan Road).
The bridge was started September 2012 and announced as a project to be completed by July 2013 - under the auspices of the governor of Laguna and Mayor of Pagsanjan (a husband/wife tandem) re-elected last May.
The bridge serves as the main connection between the town center and barangays on the other side of the Balanac river, where children cross to go to school on a daily basis, and where townspeople use to gain access to better medical facilities, in the center of town and/or to the next town, the capital of Laguna.
As the rainy season approached, the raft used to ferry people across the river had occasions of capsizing, not to mention that the same river caused havoc during the Ondoy, Sendong typhoon seasons years back.
I initially sent an email of inquiry to the Region IV-A engineers on May 6, with no success, until, on June 18, 2013, with further online research, sent an email to most in the website directory, including Ms. Elizabeth Pilorin, Chief Information Officer. She indeed followed-up and searched for the most current update/status of the bridge construction and today, she sent me an email announcing that the bridge will be open to vehicular traffic, July 30, 2013.
I would like to congratulate you and of course, Ms. Elizabeth Pilorin for giving attention to our inquiry - since we could not obtain clarificatory and verifiable updated information from our own town administration, the Region IV-A and its District offices in Laguna. Your leadership reflects our President Benigno Aquino's pledge to serve through his 'Daang Matuwid' way of streamlined government services.
I have high hopes that my kababayans will now see for themselves, that PNoy and this administration really delivers in form or service to his boss, ang sambayanan. 
Thank you,
Alma Conty

Subject: concern about a miscalculated project

'a pleasant day to whom it may concerned:

I am the current school head of Jose S. Herrera Sr. Memorial elementary School at Wawa, Pilar, Bataan. I just to want to post my concern regarding with the miscalculations made with the project sited on our school with SARO No. SARO-BMB-A-13-T000002341. the title of the said project was construction/repair of School Building amounting to PhP 150,000.00. name of Contractor: NV Balbuena Construction; Implementing Office: DPWH-Bataan 2nd District; Source of Fund: PDAF Lower House. the said project was a construction/ repair of school building but then the contractor just replaced the ceiling with 67pcs of ordinary plywood and installed 8 sets of fluorescent lights. i even called DPWH Bataan to confirm the inclusions sited in the program of work, they confirmed to me that it was just a repair of ceiling. but on my surprise, in the stated program of work, replacement of ceiling joints was also included. on the contrary, the contractor did not actually replaced the said ceiling joints but instead they just used the same old ceiling joints. the workers did not also replaced the cenepa on the other side which made the ceiling opened. they even repaired certain portions of the roofings of the said building so there will be no leaks during rainy season but then, they didnt replaced it a new one but instead they just get 20pcs of used G.I. sheets which were attached to the condemnable building located inside the school premises. the tarpaulin posted on our school fence stated that the started date was June 24, 2013 and contract completion date was july 13, 2013. In actuality they just worked for five (5) days in staggard schedule. May I just ask for an inspection regarding this matter? and is it not not necessary for us school heads to sign a completion report of a project within our jurisdiction? May we continue to deal with our obligations honestly and religiously. thank you and i''m looking forward for an immediate response regarding this matter.

"CAAC-20131188","To Whom It May Concern: Good day. I am a professor at Ateneo de Manila and I teach college students aged 17-20. They have all sorts of questions for me, and as their teacher, it is my job to give them sensible answers. Or help them find these answers. An interesting question that has pervaded our recent discussions is how there's always reconstruction going on in our roads. Let me simplify everything, exclude emotions and angst, and just humbly ask these questions to you of which I expect answers for. We'd rather hear it from you, OUR DPWH. 1. Why do we keep on digging and reblocking our roads (for me, I always get caught in traffic in Munoz Edsa, and today there's another ongoing construction)? I don't really know anything about engineering- but these roads/lanes look perfectly ok- I drive breezily on them. Please enlighten me as to why you have to do it. 2. If we've been reconstructing seemingly fine roads, WHY NOT reconstruct the ones which are in a much worse condition (I mean, really bad)? Take EDSA in front of Trinoma (uneven roads for crying out loud, too uneven an infant could notice it) for example, or Cubao. Don't they need much IMMEDIATE repair? 3. I know you've been reblocking all year round, but how come in Manila (Abad Santos, Rizal Ave), most road works are happening now- further aggravating the traffic situation, what with the start of classes and the rainy season. I really have to ask, WHY? 4. How come some road works remain idle (you don't see anyone working on them or removing the orange cones even if they've been dry for a while. Yes, they're dry- it's been a week)? This case doesn't help us. It pains us, motorists, and it makes us mad. As I hope you could tell, I am a concerned citizen of this country, and I could bet that I am one of the most disciplined citizens this country has today. With that, let me claim my right to know about the answers to the questions above. I highly expect the answers from you as you proclaim that you're a department we can reach. I thank you in advance.

Good day,

I am Mr. Bernard M. Dalmao, a resident in J.A. Clarin Street, Tagbilaran City, Bohol.

First of all i am very thankful for all official concern who initiated that project. That our road will be cemented soon.

But as of now, as a concern and effected in that project i hope that you can give us proper support that we have now.

1. we are experiencing water and light interruption
   
   1.1 ""water"" heavy equipment hit main pipe due to excavation
   1.2 water meters hit by big stones due to road widening
   1.3 service drop in our electricity hit by big trucks due to low clearance

2. no temporary access going to the main road, while the project is going on

*3. They say (contructor), they ""provide"" drainage, we hope that they provide us a proper one that cannot          make problems in the future because we are buried beside the road.
*4. They also say (contructor), they ""provide"" an access going up to the main road we hope also that one

but as of now we need that temporary decent access going to the road while the project still going on. I have student and myself need that for our daily activities.

THIS PROJECT WAS CONTRACTED BY YU CONSTRUCTION

I hope a positive response about these concern

Sirs: 
Greetings!!! 
Our sincerest appreciations for the quick action and immediate response, per the above reference for action of the DPWH Region VIII. We had an audience last August 6, Tuesday with your District Engineer, Engr. Johnny M. Acosta and Resident Engineer CP I Engr. Aurelio (Bobby) Panopio and readily acceded to our request to move the ""Lay Over"" or ""Lay Bay"" (Loading and Unloading Zone) of our property to the ""South Side"" portion of our lot located at Brgy. Lokilokon, Municipality of Wright Samar. 
We were amazed and surprised that we were given your utmost attention, considering most of you are pre occupied and busy with your daily jobs. 
May we take this opportunity to thank all of you, USEC Romeo S. Momo, ASEC Dimas S. Soguilon and Regional Director Rolando M. Asis, District Engineers and the Private Contractors for the help and immediate solution to our request. 
May your TRIBE increase, you are ALL the epitome of GOOD PUBLIC SERVICE. 
Very respectfully yours,

That stretch has recently become a chronic traffic nightmare for many motorists and jeepney commuters as well, especially after a thunderstorm near the R. Papa area where it easily floods knee deep.

I wish to thank you, on behalf of our fB group, Pagsanjan Freedom of Expression (PFoE) where this issue of the completion of the bridge was spurred by:

1. the hardships experienced by the residents of the barangays at the other side of said bridge, most specially the children who go to school in the town proper, and 
2. the sick who has to be ferried for dialysis and emergency situations who need medical attention in the town proper or transported to the next town, capital of Laguna 
3. absence of verifiable information from the local (town administration) nor DPWH Region IV-A offices and the corresponding District offices.

Your office really demonstrated the effective leadership of PNoy's administration reflected by his 'Matuwid na Landas'. I hope that my kababayans will see the resolve of President Noynoy Aquino to streamline the government services in roder to be more effective in bringing services to the people.

""IS MAKING A ROTUNDA A BETTER SOLUTION? BAKIT HINDI PA FLY OVER KUNG FLYOVER? Those who will be going around Rotunda will come from five branches, Angono, Antipolo, Hilltop, Taytay & Ortigas Ave. Extension. Calling the City Governor, in my opinion we don't think Rotunda is a VIABLE ( workable, Practical ) solution. Consider the many Dump trucks and 10 WHEELER TRUCKS that are regularly passing these intersection. Gitgitan lang muli mangyayari dito. I knew our Outgoing Barangay Captain was one of those who made the proposal as a SOLUTION to the terrible traffic in KayTikling. Lahat tayo na dumadaan dito ay lagi na lang nakikipag-PATINTERO, ganun pa din ang suma kahit magkaron ng ROTONDA. PATINTERO PA DIN YAN.

THERE WERE MANY Rotundas where traffic is indeed a headache. Look at Rotunda in Capitolyo Pasig, Rotunda Quezon City, Rotunda near NAIA. Rotunda doesnt work well with congested ROADS especially on RUSH HOURS. It may work in other countries with disciplined drivers but not in the Philippines because not all drivers here knows road courtesy.

Let the public know about this Rotunda Project. Kahit nga drawing sa billboard we can tell if it will flow smoothly or not. Widening will ease but Rotunda is a waste of money since Tikling area is small to make a Rotunda, pag itinuloy ang Rotunda, money for Juan I, money for Juan II, will just be many Juans etc...

Sir:

naimbag nga aldaw yo, Apo Secretary. DE Reynaldo M. Ubiña po ito of Isabela 2nd DEO. Reports have reached me that a top elected official in my area of assignment went to see you in anticipation of the results of the IAS conducted very recently in my DEO. Apparently the politician is apprehensive of the implication of Audit Findings which would purportedly show and establish irregularities of her former DE Evelyn C. Costales who served 1 month suspension in February - March 2012 for another irregularity. I have a strong feelings and confident that you will not lift any stone unturned in pursuing an in depth investigation against the initiators of irregularity during the tenure of Ms. Costales. I personally requested for the conduct of IAS for fear and apprehension that the misdeed or illegal acts of my predecessor might have negative effects such that the top politician in my district might request for my relieve which I truly believe you will not countenance.

Some of the irregularities are:
1. projects paid are of inferior materials quality (gabion wires)
2. tacit violation of Republic Act. No. 1390
the former DE sold her own second hand gasoline fed Pajero to the DEO (copy of deed of sale and deed of conveyance was already taken by the IAS Composite Team)
3. Overstocking of maintenance supplies.
(supplies was purchased from the hardware allegedly owned by former DE Costales)

I have strong faith in your ongoing crusade against illegal acts. As a firm beliver of your advocacy towards ""DAANG MATUWID"", I must confess to you Sir, that this top politician has an edge to grind against me as I believe that the politician is so protective to DE Costales.

I am very confident, however, that you will always be  behind those people firmly believe in your program for good governance.

Thank you very much, Sir, for your support.

Maligayang pagbati po sa inyo.

Kami po ay natutuwa sa inyong liderato, lalo na po sa pamamalakad ninyo sa departamentong kinaroroonan po natin ngayon. Sana po tularan kayo ng lahat ng mga empleyadong kagaya naming, mababa man o mataas na katungkulan sa departamentong ito. 

Kami po au humihingi ng tulong ninyo na sana ay bigyan pansin ang administrative officer ""Rosaline Cacao ng INED-2, na hindi wasto ang mga pamamalakad sa district office na kinaroroonan nito. Malakas ang loob ng AO na ito sa mga mali at corrupt na Gawain nito. Halos lahat ng empleyado sa distritong ito ay mga kamag anak sapagkat siya na mismo ang nagpapasok sa mga ito at binigyan ng mataas na posisyon bilang job orders, gayon pa man ay wala man lang silang mga legibility para sa mga posisyon kanilang hawak ngayon. Nandiyan ang mag asawang Darwin Valdez at Rachele Caburian, magkapatid na Bernadete at Matson Piniera, RJ Manuel, pawing mga kamag anak ni AO, pati na rin mga SRM ay nag tatrabaho sa loob ng office sapagkat mga kamag anak lahat ang mga ito at hindi naman sa kalsada nagtatrabaho. Tinatago ng AO ang mga perment posisyon sapagkat hinihintay na pumasa ang mga kamag anak at makakuha ng illegibility kung kayat hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa tapos ang rationalization sa distirtc na ito.

Gusto po din naming na imbestigahan niyo ang employment records ng AO sapagkat kadudaduda din po ang mga ito. Noon October 2005, palihim siya na kumuha ng civil service exam, na noon ay may permanent position na siya. Lumalabas na napermanente na siya bago pa makakuha ng civil service legibility.

Si AO ay isa rin contractor at supplier sa loob ng office. Noon panahon ni D.E. Pio Pre, talamak na pagnanakaw ang ginawa ng mga grupong ito. Ang Badoc School Building na pina imbestigahan po ninyo ay siya ang gumawa, sa pangalan ng contractor na Badoc Builders. Pati din ang trabaho sa Pinili-Nueva Era Roadna ilan ulit na imbestigahan na hindi na natapos tapos ang trabaho ay isa pang gawa ni AO, at sa huli ay ang maintenance section ang nagtapos sa trabaho. Ang overpriced na generator set sa office ay ideliver din ni AO lahat ng ito ay sa pangalan ng Valencerina Constructions. Ang mga ito ay ilan lamang sa madaming anumalya ng AO na ito. Bakit di natin pa lifestyle check si madam AO para naman Makita kung saan galling ang mga yaman nya ngayon na kahinahinala.

May mga reklamo na rin isinampa laban sa kanya, ngunit wala pa rin kasagutan sa mga reklamong ito. At sana po na kung kayoy interesadong magpa imbistiga ay magdala po kayo ng mga tiwala ninyo totoo sapagkat may mga tao rin na tumulong sa AO tuwing nasasangkot sa anumalya. Katulad po sa mga nakaraan nag imbistiga ay wala rin pong nangyari.

At kung maaari lang po, ay huwag nyo nang ipag bigay alam sa isa ninyong Asec. na galling po sa district na ito kung kayo po ay may balak mag paimbestiga. Sana po ay mabigyan pansin ang daing naming ito, para naman po maiwasto ang mali at maalis ang mga corrupt sa departamentong kanaroroonan po natin.

my property are not suppose to be affected, because of this alignment  my property is now affected. i talked to the Agbada the owner of the property that was supposed to be affected, he told me that the team of QcFED IS ASKING FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF COMMISSION. UNPON AGREEMENT WITH THE QCFED TEAM THEY WILL JUST RE ALIGNED THE PROJECT SO THAT BOTH OF THEM WILL BE BENEFICIAL. the supposed affected property will be classified as COMMERCIAL which the owner now could sell it at a HIGH PRICE, on the other side of the QCFED the other property is willing to give them commission.

IN MY CURIOSITY, I CHECK WHO IS IN CHARGE IN THE PROJECT, DISTRICT ENGINEER TOLENTINO, ENG.

Over the years, the traffic in Los Banos has escalated and become horrendous. At any time and day, travelers get stuck for an hour or more at the intersection or crossing, which is the choke point. From my point of view, one of the causes of congestion is the number of pedestrians crossing at designated points. Another is the number of vehicles going to and coming from UP Los Banos.

Hon. Reynaldo G. Tagudando
Director, NCR-DPWH

Dear Hon. Director:

With all due respect, I wish to convey my heartfelt thanks for the remarkable improvement that we are now experiencing along the stretch in 20th Avenue at Barangay San Roque, Murphy, Cubao, Quezon City near Bonny Serrano Avenue, the roadway fronting the Camp Aguinaldo grounds.

Years ago, every time we experienced a heavy downpour, the street/pavement fronting our Law Office would be inordinately flooded. In 2009 however, with the fury of Typhoon Ondoy, the ground floor of our Law Office got flooded with one (1) foot, of murky water. After that unfortunate experience of Typhoon Ondoy, we have procured sand bags to serve as improvised and miniature ""barrier-dikes"" to prevent flood waters from seeping into and/or cascading into the ground floor of our Law Office.

I have been informed that an equipment periodically being dispatched by an instrumentality of the government has since been regularly cleaning the drainage lines along the 20th Avenue stretch. Thus, for a long time even with the continuous rains brought about by the recent TWO (2) Habagat downpours, no flooding has occurred in our vicinity. As I am not in my Law Office on a 24/7 basis, and as those people awoke in the wee hours of the morning, who have witnessed the cleaning of the drainage lines cannot say with certainty as to which under your department of the government was it, I surmised that it could either by the MMDA or the DPWH. As I know that it would basically be the DPWH who is actually in charge of this kind of street maintenance works, I feel that it is your Office which has lately attained a reputation of doing remarkable things in an expeditious manner under your stewardship. In the event that I maybe imprecise , I still wish to congratulate you for the good things that you have been doing for the NCR. We are behind you and will fully support you in your various projects for the good of the country. Thank you so much, more power and God bless!

Very respectfully yours,
WALTER T. YOUNG

"CAAC-20131800","Who's responsible -- DPWH or Makati City Gov't?

AS ALWAYS, flash flood again inundated the intersection of Gil Puyat Avenue and South Luzon Expressway leading to Ayala Avenue last Oct 9 in Makati's Central Business District.

Making matters worse, the streetlights on both sides of Gil Puyat Avenue have remained useless for several months now. Pedestrians, mostly office workers waded in the flood in total darkness along the unlighted portion of the avenue. Motorists were caught in a monstrous traffic that lasted up to midnight.

Whoever is responsible -- the city government of Makati or the Department of Public Works and Highways -- should immediately remedy the perennial flooding in this vital intersection of Makati.

Busted streetlights on both sides of Gil Puyat Avenue from Mayapis to Edsa should also be of utmost concern to the proper authorities.

Sa tinagal-tagal ko na pong nagtitiis sa mga lubak- lubak na mga karsada namin dito sa bayan namin ay ngayon lang po ako naglakas ng loob na magreklamo sa departamento nyo sa kadahilanang naniniwala po kami ngayon na matino-tino na ang namamahala ngayon sa departamento nyo....tulad po ng ating Presidenteng Noynoy. We need more men like you, Secretary. Alam po namin na may kahihitnan itong sulat namin ngayon sa inyo....di po tulad ng mga taong nakaupo jan dati sampu ng mga tauhan nila. Sana lang po ay makarma silang lahat na nagpasasa sa pera ng bayan....sa perang ninakaw nila sa taong bayan!!!! Secretary, ang gusto lang po naming iriklamo sa inyo ay itong national highway sa tapat ng bahay namin sa San Pablo City, Laguna. Ilang taon na po itong ganito na lubak-lubak. Inaaspalto lang po sya ng inaaspalto...patagpi-tagpi....lalo naman pong nasisira ang aming mga sasakyan dahil di naman po kinikinis o pinapantay ang aspalto sa semento. Mayat-maya po ang mga sira ng aming sasakyan!!!! Talaga po itong pinabayaan ng aming dating Mayor Vicente Amante at ang kasalukuyang Mayor Amben Amante (son of Ex-Mayor Vicente Amante) kaya po ako na mismo ang nahingi sa inyong tulong. Kaya ko po nasabing talagang di nya ito balak ipagawa o di kaya po ay di nya inaasikasong ipagawa ay dahil dito po lahat nakatira ang mga kalaban nya sa politika. Ang nasasakupan po ng mga Brgy. na taon ng lubak-lubak ay ang mga ss.: Brgy. San Francisco(Calihan), Brgy. San Ignacio, Brgy. San Vicente, Brgy. San Antonio I at II. Pati na rin po ang mga drainage system dito na napaka-importante dahil industrial zoning po dito sa aming kinatatayuan pero wala pa nga pong drainange system ang aming locality. May mga factory na nagtayuan na po dito pero ang main problem nila ay ang drainage ng local na pamahalaan....kaya ang mga kapitbahay ng mga factory na ito ay mga nagrereklamo dahil sa kanila po napupunta ang tapon ng tubig ng mga factory na ito....dahil wala nga pong drainage ang gobyerno. Ang maganda po sana ay kung gagawa ang gobyerno ng mga karsada ay makapal na kasama na rin ang drainage at walkway o pathway na daanan ng tao....ganito pong gumawa ang Japanese government....sabay-sabay na para wala ng problema....hindi yung puro partial ang gawa. Pwede nyo po itong i-suggest kay Presidente. Sana po Secretary ay mabigyan nyo ng agarang solusyon itong mga hinaing naming ito. Dumederecho na po kami sa inyo dahil yon po ang mas effective....dahil alam po namin na pag dumaan pa kami kung kani-kanino ay wala naman pong mangyayari.

Good day!

Appreciate the response on the matter of concern raised regarding works of DPWH in front of our establishment. I am just reluctant if the works in front of my station could be finished when they started work here since June 3rd week and deadline is on Nov 15. Pictures they attached looks edited as am attaching now pictures taken today and comparing it from what the station originally looks prior to this project and see how rubbish the stations' front looks now.

Also once the area being concreted hardens what will now be our assurance on the other half will be completed on a shorter period of time? The other half have an existing retaining wall and if wall will not be restored may result to eroding of our front driveway. 

Can we request for written agreement which will include works and timeline.

Nais ko lamang 
pong iparating sa inyo ang mga litratong sumasalamin sa ating lipunan, Hindi ito pagkundena, paninisi o lalong paninirang puri sa ating mga lingkod ng Sambayang Pilipino, Ang gusto ko lamang pong mangyari ay maipakita ko po sa inyo ang mga sira-sirang kalsada ng Barangay Poblacion Bayan ng Talitay, sa Maguindanao. 
Noong unang pagpunta po namin sa nasabing lugar ay mapapansing walang pagbabago sa pamumuhay, bahay, o lalo na sa nasabing kalsada. Matagal na po ang hidwaang sumisira sa ating kapayapaan dahil mabagal o walang serbisyong napairarating sa Bayan galing sa ating Kawani ng Pamahalaan, Naniniwala din po akong kapag wala po tayong ginagawa upang mapabuti sila ay wala din mararating ang ating Peace Negotiation na sinusulong ng Administrasyong Aquino. Kaisa nyo po ako sa matuwid na landas para sa pagbabago upang makamit ang Serbisyong Makakatotohan at hindi lamang po pangako ang ating sinasabi sa Bayan.

Bagamat malayo, mapanganip, at mahirap ang pagpunta sa nasabing lugar naniniwala akong kapag tayo po ay lumapit sa kanila sa pamamagitan ng pagkumpuni ng sirang kalsadang ito ay mapapalapit din tayo sa kanilang mga puso, na nanaisin na nilang magtrabaho dahil sa bagong kalsadang inyong ipapagawa at mula doon makikita na nila ang liwanag na inagaw sa kanila ng matagal na panahon. 

Ang inyo pong ahensya na nagbibigay ng bagong pag-asa sa mga mamayan ang siyang magbibigay ng kaunlaran sa bawat isa, Sa isa-isa po nating pagtupad sa ginampanan nating tungkulin ng walang anumang kinikilingan at tapat ay maiaahon po natin ang ating bayan.

Ngayon pa lamang po ay nagpapasalamat na po ako sa inyo at alam ko pong magkakaroon din po sila ng matuwid na landas na sinasabi ng ating mahal na Pangulong Aquino baling araw.

Thank you for your response. 
 
Just remember people around the world are watching on what is the next move that the Philippine government will act to correct the current infrastructure.  This should withstand the earthquake and typhoon windspeed similar to Yolanda.
 
With the amount of donation that the Philippines received ## billion of pesos, I think this will suffice to have a house for each families that was affected by the typhoon.

Ginoo:

     Noong pong nakaraang Miyerkoles, Styembre 25, 2013, ang mga tauhan ng BACELCO, isang kontratista nakinasundo ng Manila Electric Company (MERALCO), ay nagtayo ng isang kongkretong poste sa sakop ng aking pag-aari sa kahabaan ng San Agustin Section ng Alaminos-Lipa City Road, na lalong kilala sa katawagang CALABARZON Road, sa Alaminos, sa dahilang doon umano ito itinurong itayo ng isang inhenyero ng DPWH na inyong itinalaga sa pangangasiwa sa pagpapaunlad sa nabanggit na lansangan.

     Ang nabanggit na poste ay itinayo sa loob ng aking nababakurang pag-aari na kinikilala sa Transfer Certificate of Title No. 075-2010001104, at ipinagbabayad ng buwis sa ilalim ng Tax Declaration No. 01-0003-02175 ng Taggapan ng Tasador ng Alaminos, Laguna, kaya ito po ay mahigpit kong tinututulan.

     Na upang maihanap ng katarungan ang nabanggit na pangyayari, ang impormasyon ay ipinarating ko sa inyo sa pamamagitan ng liham na may petsang Setyembre 30, 2013, na nakalulugod pong ito ay pinagtuunan kaagad ng inyong pansin, para sa pagsasagawa ng kaukulang beripikasyon, at noon pong nakaraang Biyernes, Oktubre 11, 2013 ay may tumawag ng aking pansin upang iulat na nailipat na ng kinatatayuan o nailabas na ng aking bakuran ang nabanggit na poste o utility pole para sa linya ng kuryente. Lamang, hindi ko po agad napuntahan ang nabanggit na lugar dahil sa patuloy na pag-ulan dito hatid ng Bagyong Santi.

     Ngayon pong hapon ay nadalaw ko ang aking lote, at tuloy nakunan ng larawan ang poste sa bagong kinatatayuan nito.

     Dahil po rito, malugod kong ipinaaabot ang isang matapat na pagpapahalaga at pagpapasalamt sa nagging mabilis na pag-aksyon ng inyong tanggapan sa masasabing karaingan ng isang karaniwan at walang lakas na mamamayan.

     Sana po, marami pang pinunong bayan ang maging katulad ninyo, na may pagpapahalaga at pagkilala sa karapatan ng mga mamamayan, at makatao at maklipunan sa pagbalangkas ng mga kapasyahan tungo sa kagalingang pambayan.

""KAPIT-TUKO pa rin si DPWH Sec. Rogelio Singson sa kanyang puwesto hangga't nananatili ang tiwala sa kanya ni Pangulong Noynoy Aquino.

Sinabi ni Presidential Communications Operations Office head Herminio Coloma, Jr. na buo pa rin ang tiwala at kumpiyansa ni Pangulong Aquino kay Sec. Singson hangga't hindi mapapatunayan ng Criminal Investigation at Detection Group ng Philippine National Police ang alegasyon na ito ni Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery Panfilo Lacson.

Isinambulat ni Sec. Lacson na may pagtatayo ng bunkhouses sa mga lugar na sinalanta ng bagyong Yolanda.

Samantala, aminado si House Speaker Feliciano ""Sonny"" Belmonte, Jr. na malaking dagok sa rehabilitasyon ng gobyerno sa mga sinalanta ng kalamidad ang balitang substandard at overpriced ang itinatayong bunkhouses sa Leyte at Samar.

Kasabay nito, hinihimok ni Belmonte si Rehabilitation chief Panfilo Lacson na pangalanan ang sinasabing politiko na umano'y kumikita sa pagtatayo ng mga bunkhouses o kung meron mang nakakuha ng mula 30 hanggang 35 porsiyento ng komisyon.

Kamakalawa ay tahasang sinabi ni Singson na magbibitiw siya sa pwesto kapag napatunayan na overpriced ang bunkhouses at kung may mga politikong sangkot dito.""","2014-01-08 10:53:37","1",NULL

"CFMC-20140092","Am a senior citizen 78 years old, widow, residing in Paranaque City.Purchased some groceries at SM SUCAT for my needs late afternoon yesterday, and was flagging a jeepney to commute for home. At the curb when I was about to board the jeepney, my left foot was caught by a metal rod sticking out near the canal which caused me to fall flat on my face. Hardest hit was my left knee bone which became black and blue, with some abrasions on my face and hands. My pair of double vision eye glasses is completely unusable now. Was very glad some children (jeepney dispatchers I believe), pulled me up. Then two SM security men came to my aid and brought me to the SM Mall clinic to be checked, as I was limping hard due to the injury on my left leg. I very much appreciate the very solicitous attention also of the clinic nurses, especially tending to a senior citizen like me. I was told by the security men that the long metal rod which tripped me is part of the DPWH project being performed at present. Question: I was wondering if DPWH would also pay attention to a senior citizen like me. Am actually relying only on my meager SSS pension, which cannot support medical check-ups which I may have to undergo because of my accident. The SM clinic nurse recommended that I see a doctor to evaluate my accident and undergo lab tests, etc. I may need MRI, brain scan, etc., as my head hit the pavement quite hard. At this point I am not hesitant to ask some assistance from your august office. You perform grate infrastructure work, but sometimes you also have to pay attention to Filipino citizens like us, especially who are senior citizens. Would truly appreciate if I could be given attention by your office. I do not have sufficient funding to take care of my medical needs. May I count on your response and support?

Hon. Rogelio L. Singson
Secretary, DPWH

Dear Sec. Singson;

We are writing to respectfully seek your intervention and appropriate action with regard to certain concerns of our homeowners' association. We have a number of matters that we wish you can give preferential attention. Allow is to enumerate them:

1. The U-turn slot under bridge along ARaneta Avenue beside SM Centerpoint (SM City Sta. Mesa) area is not properly utilized because of the presence informal settlers. While that portion can be allocated to service public transportation vehicles and help ease traffic, it is put to waste and is now an area of riverside settlers that contribute exceeding to flooding. The informal settlers dump their garbage on the waterway beside the bridge which causes flooding in the area during rainy season. We are also worried that in the event of an earthquake, the lives of the informal settlers under and beside the bridge, who have used the U-turn slot as residence, will be put at great risk. 

2. The middle street traffic island along Araneta Avenue, between Bayani and Palaza  Streets, has already been repaired. However, since the height is way below the standard height of middle traffic islands, some people easily placed rocks beside the island in order for tricycles to pass thru it and at the same time also paved the way for vehicles to make an illegal U-turn instead of going further to the designated U-turn slot. This poses a big danger for motorists and pedestrians. 

We we request, that since there was already a height adjustment of the Araneta Avenue center island from the corner of E. Rodriquez to Bayani St., the height adjustment be continued further up to the corner of Palaza St. This will certainly avoid accidents and maintain a smooth traffic flow along this major thoroughfare.

It is hope that you can give preferential attention to the abovementioned in order that they can be corrected at the soonest possible time.

Thank you and more power.

Truly yours, 

For the ARANETA EAST HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. (AEHA)

(Dear Sir/Madam, Greetings! Yours truly is a Senior Citizen who has been residing in Los Banos, Laguna for more than 30 years now. Over the years, the traffic in Los Banos has escalated and become horrendous. At any time and day, travelers get stuck for an hour or more at the intersection or crossing, which is the choke point. From my point of view, one of the causes of congestion is the number of pedestrians crossing at designated points. Another is the number of vehicles going to and coming from UP Los Banos. Kindly send an investigative team to evaluate and effectively recommend solutions to the problem. Putting up of an elevated pedestrian lane or flyover, among other things, can effectively reduce traffic in Los Banos.

I hope the contractor has not yet been paid in full till they clear the massive debris they left in the area .

"CFMC-20140245","Wonderful. DPWH intent to partner with Philippine universtities to address needs and use Filipino professionals and institutions to resolve those needs, is a measure that must be pushed to the maximum for the benefit of the Philippine nation. It cost more to import professionals, individuals and corporations, in millions and billions of dollars. Use these same fortunes of expenditures to pay Filipinos a competitive compensation in salaries and awards for services. Recruit professionals who have learned and benefit by being abroad, to teach and partner with universities here. To many with the 'capitalist' fever have exploited for themselves their skills. Find individuals who are honest, beyond corruption, and reward them for putting human and national leads as being first. I know they will still have a better life style than the average citizen. Great move on the part of DPWH, I hope you will spread this to all other government agencies-- all others!","2014-01-30 04:16:30","10",NULL

Dear Secretary Singson:

May we respectfully refer, for your information and appropriate action, the text complaint from Ms. Pam Jacinto lodged thru the Contact Center ng Bayan (CCB) on the stripped and blocked roads in Paranaque City and Baclaran are.

Hereunder is Ms. Jacinto's complete text message from mobile no. 0916-634-4279 as gathered by the CCB agent:

""Reklamo ko po ang area ng Paranaque Roxas Boulevard. Baclaran area tapat ng Baclaran Church hanggang sa Roxas Boulevard Pasay area, pagkalampas ng EDSA Roxas Boulevard Flyover ng Center Island tila ginagawan ng poste't dagdag pa ang pagbakbak nito sa kalsada. Maging practical sana ang mga ito sa pagpapa-repair ng bakbak style. Kalyeng may potholes at iba pa na napakatagal ng hindi naaayos. Gawing spalto na lang ang kalye kaysa sa bakbak. Madaming sira at wlalang kalye. Nirereklamo ko din ang Multinational road bungad sa Sucat Road papasok then to C5, opposite side shortcut ito to Paranaque City Hall. Barangay San Agustin, Fasttrack Area, Dona Soledad exit. Then iyong sa Better Living United Nations Road rin to International School pa naman ay tinapalan lahat ng kalye.""

May we request your office's assistance and preferential attention on the matter. We shall await information on the action taken by your office within five (5) days upon receipt thereof via our email address: csc.palo.pacc@gmail.com or fax number (02) 932-0179.

As per our inquiry our Accounting Department has yet to make the necessary budget. This we could not understand why they haven't done it yet.

The more saddening part is our J.O.s still has not received their salary for the last half of the month of December.

Dear Sir Sec. Singson:

Ako po ay isang lihitimong contractor ng Dpwh na nakabase ditto sa bayan ng Narra, Palawan. Ako po ay sumulat upang iparating ang aming hinaing bilang grupo sa nasabing opisina. Ang amin po problema ay tungkol sa isang  empleyado ng nasabing opisina na ang pangalan ay Engr. Antonio Escala, siya po ang dating chief supervisor ng Construction Section ng Narra District Office na hanggang ngayon ay di pa nalilipat o natatanggal dahil daw sa lakas niya sa politico.""

""Ang problema namin sa kanya ay ang sapilitan niyang paghingi o pagkuha o pagsubcontract ang aming contrata o proyekto. Kapag hinde kami sumang0ayon sa kanyang kagustuhan ay hiniharas po niya kami sa pamamagitan ng kung anu-ano ang hinahanap na papeles sa implementasyon lalo na sa koleksiyon. Lahat ay pinupuna niya ang mga nagawa na kahit halos hinde naman pumupunta sa proyekto para bantayan, kaya napipilitan kami na ibigay sa kanya ang proyekto at royalty fee na lang ang sa amin o di kaya ay ibinibigay namin ang labor para siya ang magpatrabaho na walang kung anu-ano ang hinahanap.""

""Kami po ay nangangamba dahil kung minsan ay di nya sinusunod ang nakaplano at ispisikasyon ng opisina lalo na sa proyekto na malayong lugar at baka ang lisensya naman namin ang maapektuhan kung matuklasan ito ng inyong opisina. Sana po ay matulungan ninyo kami sa pamamagitan ng pagtanggal sa kanya o paglipat sa ibang opisina kagaya ng opis sa region sa Manila tulad noon detailed sya sa region dahil din sa ginawa niya na anomalya.""

""Bilang patunay sa aming akusasyon, kalakip po dito ay ang sipi ng affidavit ng aming kasamahan sa hanapbuhay na nakadanas ng katulad na harassment at naglakas loob na nagbigay ng affidavit pero hanggang ngayon ay wla pa rin katugunan ang nasabing opisina. Kami po ay makikipagtulungan king sakali po ay inyong aksiyonan sa pamamagitan ng imbistigasyon at kami po ay kusang magpapakilala at magbibigay ng patunay sa Gawain illegal ng inyong empleyado sa Narra Palawan 2nd district office.""

Last March 13, 2013 I retired from the service by operation of law on age 65 compulsory retirement. I retired as DPWH District Engineer of Bohol 2nd Engineering District, Bood, Ubay, Bohol. I am really worried because until to date my claim for Terminal Leave Benefits was never acted upon by the concerned authorities. I am in quandary situation where to go. Yes sir tis is clear cut violation of the CSC MC No. 7 and its implementing Rules and Regulations. Sometime in August 2013 I was informed by the DPWH Region VII, that my claim already forwarded to DPWH Central Office and was eventually submitted to DBM. Since that period I got no more information what so ever. Hence, Im writing this for help. I am one of the victims of the 7.2 magnitude killer quake and the super typhoon Yolanda in Bohol. I am afraid that some of our brothers & sisters in the government are backsliding sa Daang Matuwid. More Power and God Bless!”

What causes apprehension and confusion among the residents of Albuera, and specially those living along the said road subject for widening, is that the extent of the road-widening reaching to as much as 10 meters from the center on both sides of the road, is so wide that houses and properties along the way are in danger of being demolished. This is as if the volume of vehicles passing through this road is as big as that in big cities! And what is worse is that the project engineer of the DPWH District Office in the province (or in Ormoc City) said that owners of the properties that will be affected by the said road-widening project will not get paid. That is why he, the project engineer, is prodding the affected residents to VOLUNTARILY demolish their respective properties. By this alone we could sense something fishy in the implementation of this project. In addition, we would like also bring to your attention, Honorable Secretary that this project was implemented without even conducting a public forum or public consultation with the local residents regarding the project. That is why residents here now are very disappointed because of this lack of transparency of this project, knowing that transparency and accountability in projects is now being stressed by the present administration of President Noynoy Aquino. That's why, Dear Secretary, we are appealing to you to first put on hold or stop this project. Our municipality, a coastal municipality, is so small and is in fact just a third class municipality. Its land area is even getting smaller now (and in fact is getting smaller everyday)because of typhoons and the big waves that are constantly eating or washing out our coastal land areas. If the project would push through, so much space would be eaten up for the widening of the road, while areas for residents whose population is increasing at a fast pace, would be so much diminished. If indeed the district office is very sincere in its project and considerate with the residents of the very small town proper of Albuera, why not instead push for the construction of a diversion road that would run through from Ormoc to Albuera and to the next City, Baybay City without crisscrossing the inside portion of the small town proper of Albuera. This way our very small town, Albuera, who is not yet even fully recovered from the destruction wrought by typhoon Yolanda can be preserved and saved. Thank you Mr. Secretary for giving us this communication line where we will be able to reach you to air complaints and appreciation for your office. I will appreciate it very much if I can get a reaction from your end on this information, complain,and appeal from you so that I can relay it to my town mates and hopefully for us to be rest assured that something positive will result. Once again, thank you and Mabuhay. Respectfully yours, Ricardo A. Fian","2014-02-13 08:50:38","5",NULL

"CFMC-20140431","TO MS. ARLEEN D. BELTRAN ET AL District Engineer, Metro Manila 2nd Dist. Engring Office DPWH NCR, 2ND Street, Port Area, Manila Today is a most blessed day for me. The Good Lord Above never abandons His children, especially those who cry for help. He did answer my cry! On January 15th I reported thru this DPWH Feedback form that I, a senior citizen, met with an accident at the SM Sucat Mall while flagging a ride for home. After I submitted that report, I left it to the Lord whether or not my report would deserve attention from a huge government office like yours and decided to forget about it. Today, Feb. 5th,at 3:00 p.m. (my Divine Mercy hour), a representative from the DPWH NCR Port Area office called up that he had to see me, well, perhaps to investigate my accident. So I gave him directions to my home. I welcomed Mr. Rafael Santiago, DPWH Records Officer and his companion driver, Mr. Francisco Romaguira. Frankly, I did not know what to say or do after Brod Rafael informed me that DPWH indeed received my complaint and request for assistance. And to top it all, handed me an envelope and said that the contents came from his office mates and friends who learned about my plight. That it was a form of ""ambagan"" which would help out in my needs for medical attention in view of the accident. I therefore take this opportunity to thank each and everyone of you who have shared a part of your treasures to help a senior citizen like me who met an accident. Words are not enough to express the appreciation I feel for your generosity. Nag-uumapaw po ang aking puso sa inyong kagandahanng-loob.

"CFMC-20140435","To whom it may concern: I live in the province of Sorsogon and I noticed recently that a lot of our roads are being rehabilated and many are undergoing road expansions. And for these, I am grateful and happy. However, with all these improvements, I see a parallel of 'disimprovement'. What I'm referring to are the annoying 'barricades' along the national roads in front of almost all the government elementary schools here in Sorsogon province. People say that these help in preventing road- related accicents in front of schools. But these schools are already equipped with brightly painted pedestrian lanes and pedestrian safety warnings. And despite these,and despite the presence of barangay tanods in front of almost every school, who help kid cross the road, the barangay tanods are very industrious and faithful in putting these 'barricades' that make all these roads in front of schools 'one- way'. As if this is one of the duties of the barangay tanods- most of these 'barricades' are left there even when the students are already in school, so that the B. tanods can leave their posts in front of school and probably do something else. It is very annoying to see our national roads being widened and at the same time pass through all these one- way barricades along almost every school in our province.","2014-02-04 12:50:46","4",NULL

"CFMC-20140494","Dear DE Macud,
This has reference to what we have agreed in the 19 February 2014 Meeting held in your office, that AKH (AUKH) Representative will meet me on the noon time of 21 February 2014 at the DOF Building to discuss the decision of their company regarding compensation for the expenses incurred. Please refer to attached copy of minutes. 

Unfortunately, up to this date, AUKH and its representatives have failed to make any correspondence with the undersigned.

With this, I would like to solicit again your intervention in urging the contractor to abide by what was agreed upon regarding compensation for damages the soonest time possible. It was almost two months since I and the Rabino couple were victimized by the irresponsibility of the AKH to comply with the construction standards, but until now we have not received any form of assistance from them. 

We have brought this matter to your Office regarding the non-compliance of the contractor with the DPWH Dept. Order No. 56, Series of 2005 (and the DOLE Dept. Order No. 13, Series of 1998 and the non-installation of mandatory project billboard) hoping that the matter will be addressed satisfactorily. It was your Office's decision to simply require the contractor to compensate all the damages brought by the said incident to facilitate the solution of the problem. But up to now such proposed solution has not brought about a satisfactory outcome because of the Contractor's consistent non-compliance with procedures and agreements. 

Hoping for your prompt and favourable response on the matter.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

"CFMC-20140522","Good day! Nag emial na din po ako sa DPWH RO Alquiza ngunit walang sagot

I would like to write to your office to seek assistance regarding DPWH on-going projects in Ma-a, Davao City.

Dalawa po ang aking concern:

Last Friday, I called up DPWH office to simply ask for checking on the “done” re-blocking or cementing of Ma-a Road in front of Metroville Subdivision. I told the one I talked to, whose name escapes me, na sana ayusin yung warning at isipin ang safety ng lahat ng gumagamit ng kalsada. 
1. Kapag galing ka sa loob ng Metroville palabas sa Ma-a Road, MALAKI ang posibilidad ng aksidente dahil blind ka sa mga sasakyan na galing sa kaliwa na mabilis ang mga takbo. Ang warning na nilagay ng mga tauhan ng construction or ng contractor ay immediate sa ginawang semento. Wala man lang ample warning sa mga motorist at sa galing sa Subdivision. Para bang nag iimbita ng aksidente.

2. Ang drainage contruction sa entrance ng Metroville Subdivision – Hindi pa ito sinesementuhan hanggang sa ngayon. Tapos na ba ito o hindi pa? Temporary lang ba dahil kailangan pang ayusin? Ang mga tambak ay unti unti ng nalalagas at hindi na pino ang pag approach papasok at palabas ng Metroville. Pangit na po ang quality ng temporary na tambak. Humiling po ako na sana ayusin man lang para hindi naman ito sagabal at madaling makasira sa sasakyan. Ngunit, isang Linggo na ang tawag ko bukas, WALA pa rin po nabigyan ng importansiya. 

Ang sa akin lang po, sana naman maaksiyunan at sana sa mga susunod na mga proyekto, maisip naman ninyo o ng inyong Contractor ang kapakanan ng mga tao na naaapektuhan ng mga ipinpatupad na mga proyekto.

Maraming salamat po at sana mabigyang aksyon ang hiling ko.

To whom it may concern:
 
     This  has reference to our long lost communication w ith regards to improvement of our road situated at San Juan Village Chrysantimum Village Bangkal Davao City.  True enough, we thank you so much because action was then made to concretize the said road, however it was not done as requested since it  did not cover the whole but only 50%.  We were then inform that funds were not available to implement the whole project so we have to wait for funds.   The untiring wait seems to no avail because the missing link of the road now has been filled up from time to time but it made the condition worst because they filled it up with sandy soil.  You can personally check this out to witness the after effects.  Children and adults suffers soooo much with dust coming in and out of the road towards our houses and mostly of the residents getting sick because of this dusty road ... not only dust but sand ... small particles going to our eyes.
 
     Is this being humane ... Filipinos against Filipinos ... where are the hearts of those in power.  Can we poor citizens not living in plush villages don't worth to enjoy living comfortable places ... We are witness to all government questionable funding ...PDAF .. IT ENTAILS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS ,, why cant we poor citizens be given this road we ask to improved.. Are the comforts of life only for the rich and powerful ..
 
     I  hope the office of the President and DPWH MAIN office will have a heart to check on this  and advise us of what we are supposed to do to solve our problems particularly this road.

"CFMC-20140631","I wish to call your attention to the condominium project of Filinvest along EDSA Philam Homes across the Trinoma Mall in Quezon City. The sidewalk alongside the project has cracked and the Gutter is already detached from the road pavement. This will weaken the base coarse of the road since water will seep into the crack as they are pumping water from the excavation. The contractor has made a cosmetic on the sidewalk by plastering the cracks with cement. I believe that this is not enough as the ground under it has already tilted as manifested by their enclosure. kindly look into this matter since it can cause destruction of the sidewalk and road. I am confident that you will act promptly on this matter as you have done so in the past when I wrote you about the ""Landing"" portion of the Magallanes flyover from SLEX to EDSA Northbound.

"CFMC-20140640","I am Albert Grupe, owner of the building at 2400 Syquia corner Havanna Street Santa Ana. Recently there is  a 2meter x 4meter wooden  structure built right on Syquia  street in front of our building obstructing traffic since it protrudes to the street obstructing traffic on that  narrow street. We asked its 5 occupants for a building permit but could not produce one.They claim they  were allowed by the barangay to build there and that they are contractors hired by the DPWH.They even gave me their phone numbers:

536-3477 and 302-9196 .

And claim they can be reached by texting 2920.

Now aside from obstructing traffic, that illegal structure has become a sore point for the building which I am trying to sell. Some prospects  wont even consider buying because of this obstructive eyesore. It is also located in front of  the garage making driving in and out of the building extremely difficult.
 Can you please help me  resettle this structure  where it will not block traffic?

Thank you,

"CFMC-20140647","Today is a most blessed day for me. The Good Lord Above never abandons His children, especially those who cry for help. He did answer my cry! On January 15th I reported thru this DPWH Feedback form that I, a senior citizen, met with an accident at the SM Sucat Mall while flagging a ride for home. After I submitted that report, I left it to the Lord whether or not my report would deserve attention from a huge government office like yours and decided to forget about it. Today, Feb. 5th,at 3:00 p.m. (my Divine Mercy hour), a representative from the DPWH NCR Port Area office called up that he had to see me, well, perhaps to investigate my accident. So I gave him directions to my home. I welcomed Mr. Rafael Santiago, DPWH Records Officer and his companion driver, Mr. Francisco Romaguira. Frankly, I did not know what to say or do after Brod Rafael informed me that DPWH indeed received my complaint and request for assistance. And to top it all, handed me an envelope and said that the contents came from his office mates and friends who learned about my plight. That it was a form of ""ambagan"" which would help out in my needs for medical attention in view of the accident. I therefore take this opportunity to thank each and everyone of you who have shared a part of your treasures to help a senior citizen like me who met an accident. Words are not enough to express the appreciation I feel for your generosity. Nag-uumapaw po ang aking puso sa inyong kagandahanng-loob.

For lack of people to do jobs that were vacated by ""eo 366 affected employees"" the hiring officers of this department are flooding the central office with job order employees. a. Job order employees are usually relatives, neighbors or persons that came from the province of DPWH Officers with influence to HRAS (hiring personnel/group.) b. These job order employees are doing jobs of regular plantilla positions and are qualified for said positions. Most of them CPA's and engineers. These give them undue advantage over new applicants who have no relations or connections to HRAS and other hiring officers. c. They are actually being groomed for the positions vacated by the ""eo366 affected employees"". d. Job Order employees are not given personal benefits because according to management alibi, there is no employer employee relationship that exist between DPWH and job Order employees contrary to the activities from a to c above. Being thecase our employees union cannot act on their status as of this time. 2. Citing management's reasons to hire Job Order employees which is the 'lack of persons to do jobs vacated by the ""eo 366 affected employees"" The regular employees are not being allowed to work overtime. Worse, the brilliant bureau directors are not moving a finger to pay ovetime work already done by the regular employees at the height of ""eo 366 affected employees"" claim for compensation when activites in the central office skyrocketed. Even affected employees who were supposed to have terminated their services were still working up to the early part of february, 2014.

(letter, certified true copy of police blotter & invitation to bid attached)



""October 18, 2013


H.E. Benigno Simeon Aquino III
President, Republic of the Philippines
Malacanang Palace 
Metro Manila


Sir President:

In line with your crusade for reforms in governance i.e “tuwid na daan”, may we bring to your attention a case involving a rigged bidding process which may be reflaction of the prevailing modus operandi at the bids and awards committees (BACs) at the Albay DPWH 3rd District office here in Bicol.

This case pertains to the small project: Construction of Flood Control Dike along Talisay River East Carisac, Libon, Albay worth P9.65-million (project no. 13F00032) where I, Edwin Balatucan, represented AARCON Builders, and was hoping to legally join the bidding on October 8, 2013 at DPWH, Ligao City.

The BAC harassed me by asking for all sorts of requirements like Contractor Certificate of Registration (CRC) and ID which are not stated in the Invitation to Bid (ITB), Bids Data Sheet (BDS) and the Revised IRR of R.A 9184 in the matter of dropping of bid proposal. Normally, the CRC is only required in the purchase of tender documents.

I have been dropping bid documents for AARCON at DPWH region. Albay 1st and 2nd districts, DPWH Cam Sur 1st District, DPWH Sorsogon and the BAC there did not ask for the CRC during the bidding.

Prior to the bidding, a man who introduced himself to me as Engr. Ronal said to me in a loud shouting voice “pinsan ako ni Gne. Ronalo! Tao ako ni Congressman Gonzalez! Hndi mo a ako kilala?!” He offered to bribe me, to pay the expenses of AARCON in the preparation of the latter’s bid documents. He told me to wait. I later learned that he was actually Ramos Relato who is the owner of ELKAN Construction. But he did not return before the deadline (2:00 p.m.) for dropping of the bid documents so I dropped the bid documents at 1:58 p.m.

I realized that it was only his strategy to have me disqualified. The bac together with ang relato returned at the BAC pffice at 2:05 p.m. If I did not drop my bid documents because I was still waiting for him I would have been disqualified.

After dropping our documents, Relato falsely accuse me of creating trouble at the BAC office and called a CIDG agent to have me arrested. But the agent, after finding out that his allegations were false, left without arresting me.

At  March 2:45 p.m. Relato together with the BAC employees—Engrs. Edgardo Gosrospe, Marlo Matamorosa, and Jelson Padilla removed the chain and opened the padlock of the bidding box and took out the bidding documents of AARCON Builders.Gorospe told me that Atty. Rodolfo of DPWH Legal told them to do it. So AARCON Builders was not able to participate with the 13 other contractors in the bidding which started at 4:45 p.m. already more 2 and 45 mins of 2:00 officila bid opening time.

I believe that Relato was in cahoots with the BAC employees and Atty. Rodolfo I. Personally saw Relato and his secretary enter and leave the BAC office at will. I also learned later that he was the taker, the arranged winner of the bidding.

Mahal na Pangulo, naniniwala po ako sa wagas ang iyong hangarin na alisin ang korapsyon. Huwag mo pong hayaang manatili ang mga tiwaling Gawain sa DPWH. Sana po ay magtagumpay ka sa iyong krusada tungo sa matuwid na gobyerno para makatikim naman kaming mahihirap ng kaginhawaan. Mabuhay ka po!

I am asking because last Thursday, I saw a long and narrow cut on said sidewalk. The cut runs from the gate of the school till the corner of Katipunan and Aurora Blvd. As you know, many people—including students, professionals, and persons with disability—use this sidewalk everyday as they go to and from the LRT station. Halving the sidewalk would endanger the lives of these people on foot. I look forward to your prompt reply. Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: AIM presentation of the Needs Assessment and Capacity Development Plan 
 
Dear Beth, 
Greetings! 
 
I hope this email finds you well. I would like to inform you that the AIM is already in the final stages of producing their reports regarding the Needs Assessment and Capacity Development Plan (CDP) for the DPWH. We hope to receive the reports and do a quick review of the submissions within the week. Meanwhile, I would like to ask the DPWH, what would be the best possible date in which we can dedicate a schedule for report presentation by AIM. Initially, we are thinking that the participants to the said presentation be attended by Secretary Singson (if possible), Usec. Pacanan, Usec. Asis, other relevant top management officials representatives from the Stakeholders Relations Service, Planning, Budgeting, and Selected Regional Offices, who participated in the KIIs and Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted by the Institute. 
 
We are thinking of targeting the presentation within the period of April 14-16. But again, we leave it to DPWH to determine the most feasible date as soon as possible and to secure availability of the targeted participants to the said presentation.  
 
Hoping to hear from you soon. 
 
Thank you very much.
 
Sincerely, 
Chito","2014-04-02 09:16:40","5",NULL

"CFMC-20141040","Dear Sir/Madam; I am a resident of Niugan, Angat, Bulacan where the present road and drainage constructions are. We are glad for the improvement however, we can not understand how the roads that are still on a very good conditions (majority of the portion of what is being constructed). Sadly, if you will just inspect the full length of the roads, there seems to be a lack of priority where the government funds should be allocated. There are more damaged roads where these budget could had been properly spent. What we were told, the project will run for two years!! May we request that your Field Engineers and Inspectors inspect the ongoing constructions. The very inefficient constructions of the roads are harming us and to cite: - Too slow constructions - Digging several areas and leaving unfinished - Unnecessary heavy traffic - Too much dusts and dirts caused by the manner the roads are constructed - A very unacceptable ways of constructing some parts of the drainage I will try to send some pictures of the samples of how the constructions are ongoing to give you an idea on all. We do hope and pray that you will do the immediate action and correction on all considering how the residents are affected by all these. Thank you very much. Irene L.","2014-04-21 10:34:19","4",NULL

I would like to call your attention on the unfinished work that the contractor left for the access road from SLEX to Don Bosco Makati. That access road has been closed for so many months and caused horrendous traffic. When they fully opened a few months ago, they left portions of the covers for some flood control panels protruding causing traffic slowdown and very likely to cause major damage to any vehicle that may hit the steel corners. Please have someone visit so they can see what the contractor has left behind. They should be penalized and forced to repair at their own expense those protruding covers.

Clearly, there has been a lack of planning and research on DPWH side. Why cut the trees if you can build around it? Why can't you save the trees, help the environment and have a beautiful island of trees in the middle to divide the lanes? I have only lived here in New Jersey for 5 years but I have seen how trees and nature in general is a major consideration before any construction is ever made. Of course you'd tell me our country is not like the United States but please, doesn't common sense apply? Have you not known that we, a small country at that contributes a little bit to the rainforest chain----the only rain forest chain on this earth---to benefit of all us living on earth? You need to reconsider all your plans that involve cutting trees that are more than a 100 years old. DPWH has to really reconsider. I hope you will carefully think about this.

Im very much delighted to see that finally the road wideing is now full swing.  I thought is is just a dream to see in this lifetime a decent wide road    

connecting the North to the South part of Metro Manila.   

If only you could see the smile and relief  for us living in the North area (CAMANAVA).

We are  passing this route since it id  shortest route going to Manila.  At last a decent wide road linking the poor north with the relatively wealthier 

south part of manila.

Good roads are vital for the development of the whole metro manila.

On the reverse side ang mga tao s babain nila eh mahihirap pa din hanggang ngayun. Why is that so Secretary??? kasi po yung SOP n tinatawag s DPWH including the Engineeering and Administrative Overhead s Program of Work eh sa kanila lang dumadaloy s babain nila binibigyan lng ng dalawang daan for every project worth 10 million at kung minsan wala pa. Ang Engineering and Administrative Overhead s Program of Work Secretary Singson ay d po napapakinabangan ng mga emplyadong mas mababa sa kanila dahil itoy pinaghahati-hatian nila lamang. Magtanong po tayo s mga regular na emplyado po ukol s sinasabi ko po para mapatunayan n totoo po ito. Nepotism is also an issue in DPWH 1st DEO secretary dahil ang mga anak nila mga kamag anak pinsan oh sino mang malapit s kanila ay tauhan nila s loob ng kanilang departamento. Ilang beses na pong naulit ang reklamong nepotism pero binabalik at binabalik pa din nila ang kanilang mga kamag anak para s departamento nila mgtrabaho.Anung aksyon po ba ang gagawin natin secretary para sa mga reclamong ito??? Isa pa po secretary ay ang mga proyektong walang silbi kundi ang pera ng bayan ay ginagastos lng ng walang pakinabang tulad ng Proyektong RECHANELLING. Pag umulan po secretary yung lupa n itinambak gamit ang loder ay mg e-erode lang at babalik ulit ang problema. S di po napapansin ng marami ang RECHANELLING po yearly po yan at napakamahal pa po. S rechanelling o dredging kumikita ng milyon milyon ang mga Department Heads at OIC's District and Assistant Engineers.Hindi napapansin ng secretary (kung hindi sya ngbubulagbulagan) ang problemang ito dahil tinatakpan po ng DPWH Regional Office San Fernando La Union dahil pg ng inspect sila eh my under the table n po kaagad n malaking pera. Ang tanong bakit po ang DPWH Regional Office San Fernando La Union ay di ngsasabi ng totoo about s totoong ngyayari po s DPWH 1st DEO s Ilocos Sur??? Ang Rehabilitation po ng Caoayan Bridge s Caoayan Ilocos Sur is underrun by almost 30% so ano pong action ang dapat gawin ukol dito??? Secretary Singson pls buksan natin ang ating mga mata alam kung matalino ka. Ang talinong taglay mo ay sana magamit s tama at hindi s pagnanakaw ng pera ng bayan. Action po kayo agad kung may mga puso pa kayo, kung gusto ninyong tulungan ang mga emplyadong nghihirap ng husto n hindi nakakatikim ng SOP n tama lng ay para sa kanila at kung sa tuwid n daan po talaga ang gusto nyong daanan.

I don't know if you planned this city wide projects but, from what we experienced your agency is and still disorganized. We dropped off my kids in Don Bosco Sta Mesa and it will took me an hour and half before I reached my office in Pasay City. Can you expedite and fast track your repairs? It seems you are trying to show off to the public that your agency is doing a fine thing job. Well, it's not! I think you better count the number of commuters who cursed your workers because of your massive so called road and drainage improvements. Don't tell me to leave early because the school opens at 6 am and my wife and I are working from 8 am to 5 pm. I have to dropped her off in Pasong Tamo, Makati City first before heading to Pasay City. We are always late since last week because of your agency and so called projects of improvements! Do what is best finish the project the soonest. Is there any money involved that leads to corruption that's why this repairs are taking so long? Is it a red tape from the City of Manila agency? Your agency doesn't have any concerns to the public and commuters! Remember all roads in Sta Mesa and Sta Ana are being wrecked and sad to say there are few labourer spotted in the site. You have also to consider that these roads leads to schools, hospitals, wet market, bridge and churches and should be a busy street that need to fasten up the completion of projects! I just hope that you will take immediate action on my complaint and if not, then the image I saw in your agency doesn't change since time immemorial...bulok pa rin sistema! Sana lang walang issue sa corruption na puwede maging dahilan nang pagka delayed! John Paul

Teacher in toilet bowl mishap gets P15K from contractor

By Jing Castaneda, ABS-CBN News

Posted at 06/30/2014 8:08 PM | Updated as of 07/01/2014 1:39 AM


MANILA - The Department of Education (DepEd) is still waiting for the report of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) regarding a teacher's accident with one of the toilet bowls at the Kauswagan Central School in Cagayan de Oro (CDO) City last June 19.

Elementary school teacher Mary Portia Alemanio suffered an open wound in her buttocks after the toilet bowl in the restroom of the public school broke into pieces after she sat on it. The teacher was given seven stitches in a hospital.

DepEd Assistant Secretary Tonisito Umali said school principal Joel Lariba has already submitted an official report to the DepEd and to the DPWH about the incident.

Engineer Virginia Batocail, CDO assistant district engineer, earlier inspected the school's toilet and found defects in the construction of the toilet bowl.

Records show that the contractor, GIM PAB Enterprises, had shouldered the medical expenses of Alemanio and extended to her P15,000 financial assistance.

The toilet bowl was also replaced by the contractor.

GIM PAB is also responsible for the construction of toilets in six other schools.

The DPWH is looking into possible defects in the toilet bowl, in which case the contractor will be held liable, or the improper use of the bowl as the reason for the accident.

The DepEd is doing its own investigation to make sure the incident does not happen again.

The comfort rooms were constructed in 2013, a project implemented by the DPWH.

Based on standard operating procedures, the contractor has a one-year liability for any maintenance or correction of defects in the infrastructure.

The DPWH, DepEd and the school division are the ones who sign the certificate of completion before the infra project is turned over to the school.

Umali said this is the first time they've received reports of this nature.

He assured the public of the safety of public school facilities, specially given the regular inspections done by each school's own personnel.","2014-06-30 09:02:29","5",NULL

They a depot in the area West of Mira Verde Avenue and North of Del Carmen Street, with exist to both of these roads. This morning, Mira Verde was covered in mud. The other day it was in Del Carmen, and all the way down Lourdes Street.
Question
1.Isnt it a Road Traffic offence to deposit mud on roads? Therefore, isn’t if the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the wheels on the trucks are cleaned of mud before they go on the roads?
2. Shouldnt DPWH supervise the actions of its contractors to ensure that they don’t deposit mud on the roads?
Please advise what action you will take to solve this problem.
This mud is not only a hazard on the roads, but also it will block the drains if it gets washed down into them

"CFMC-20141873","Hello, I need to get the full details regarding the DPWH project road expansion in Sariaya, Quezon town proper. I learned from a relative that the road expansion will affect tombs situated near the road. I have made several overseas calls to the Office of the Mayor and unable to get full disclosure of what the plan is. My dad was buried October of last year and we wanted to know how and when his body is going to be relocated. We heard that there will be a common tomb for bones and will be marked accordingly thus a family representative is necessary. I have not receive any information about bodies that are not yet bones. We heard some family decided to relocate their dead love boss at their own expense and we are not willing to do so after spending already much of last year's funeral service. I trust that the government had laid out a plan for this project and how relocation will be facilitated. I am frustrated how hard it is to get facts from Sariaya Quezon Mayor's Office and it is causing us who live out of the country anxiety, time and money to know what the plan is. I hope to receive a response at your earliest convenience. I will still pursue my repeated contacts to Sariaya Quezon Mayor's office and other means I can to get the official details about this project. Thank you in advance for your attention!

Let us not wait for that to happen to our other family members and friends. Let us also not wait for the LGU of Taytay to make a request regarding this. If there is already a request to put/install streetlights along this stretch, then good. Please act on this ASAP as this is long overdue. That's all. Thank you & God bless! P.S.

"CFMC-20141878","I would like you to investigate the project of ENGR. DAISY D. AMISTAD, DPWH XII CCDEO, Project Engineer of the CY 2011 Regular Infra of Matampay II Access Road. The said project is declared completed as of Dec 2013 but until now nakatiwangwang pa rin. Rainy season na babaha na dito. The project was started on October 27, 2011 and supposed to be completed on February 12, 2012. CY 2014 napo tayo, ano napo ang hocus focus dito? Over Slippage na eto pero walang liquidated damages imposed sa contractor sa lagayan. Hindi naman nila na-follow ang contract quantities infact they deviate the plan - and reduced the length. Contract should supposed to have one variation order only mukhang nakarami eto kung ginawa nga? Ang excavation dito ay supposed to be 1.5m depth since ang lupa dito ay muck and peat. Ang ginawa nila dito ay nag excavate ng half meter, nag-embankment fill ng half meter(item 104) at nag slab na sila. Ang line canal naman na supposed to be removed, excavate and replaced ay pinatungan na lang nila ng 0.20m CHB then tinakpan ng sidewalk slab on top of it. Kulang rin ang length ng PCCP nila. sobra sobra ang quantities ng RSB(404)na hindi nilagay pero na disbursed, pinaghati-hatian nila ang pera, masyado silang yumaman dito. Imagine a road of L=800meters will cost P60 Million without putting a line canal and just an excavation and filling of half-meter without sub-base and base courses. Ang daming nabayaran sa pay quantities pero hindi nailatag like items 104, 200, 600, 612, spl-1,2,3,4 at marami pang sobrang quantities na although hindi nailagay ay nabayaran. At the worst happened - Lahat ng eto ay lumusot at nabayaran. This is just a truly manifestation of skewing a Presidential Agenda of Reform - Tuwid na Daan. I believe it really contradicts the DPWH Secretary's honorable directives.

Grabe ang ginagawang reblocking dyan sa Javellana st., Lapaz, Iloilo city. maliban sa napakabagal, wala pang order ang pagkagawa. Na-notice po namin na inumpisahang sirain yung daan noon pang mga 1st semester ng nakaraang pasukan 2013-2014, halos hindi ginawa ito noong summer at nag commence lamang sila uli nang mag-umpisa na naman ang 1st semester nitong pasukan 2014-2015. At ang masama, di pa natapos yung naunang portion ng kanilang reblocking, dinagdagan na naman ang pambabasag dito malapit sa eskwelahan ng WVCST kaya lalong nagkabuhol-buhol ang trapik. Di ba naisip ng mga contraktor na ito, ang epekto sa mamamayan, nale-late ang estudyante sa umaga at na-e-estranded naman sa hapon pag-uwi dahil maagang gumagarahe ang mga dyip dahil sa trapik. Sa pagkaka-alam ko, lahat ng project ng gobyerno ay may timetable at dapat naka post yan on-site sa lugar kung saan ang proyekto, pero dito wala kaming nakikita, kaya iniisip namin na baka pagana-gana lamang sa contractor kung kelan nila gustong gawin ito. Ako po ay nagtuturo sa WVCST at medyo may kapansanan sa paglalakad, masyado akong apektado dahil hindi ko kayang makipag-agawan sa pampasaherong dyip at kelangan ko halos mag taxi araw-araw, at baka yung konti kong kinikita sa pagtuturo ay mapunta na lamang sa pamasahe. Sinulat ko na po ito dahil ini-expect ko'ng mag ta-tatlong sakay na ako sa simula nito semester dahil sa panibagong reblocking na inumpisahan ng contractor nitong proyekto. DPWH tuparin nyo naman po yung motto nyo ""Right Project, Right Cost, Right Quality, and Right on Time"" dahil kaming mga empleyado nagbabayad naman ng tamang buwis at nangangailangan ng kapalit na tamang serbisyo galing sa ahensya ng gobyernong katulad ninyo.

"CFMC-20142027","Location is along kristina homes lubogan toril davao city. Along Lubogan, Toril Davao city road connecting calinan davao city roads There was this road widening. We were called thrice about it. The third time was asked for bank account where dpwh payments for affected properties be sent. The widening has started mid 2013. They made the one lane roads to its standard width from the previous street size road. They dig for canals and cemented them opposite our side of the house. Then they just destroyed our side of canals and our cemented drive way sometime in August 2013. Then the contractors just stop operation. Then this month their back in operation. Yesterday because its weekday nobody is in our house. They again dig the canal. They did not return the wooden bridge for me to able to cross to the gate of my house, the wooden bridge they provided when we complained way back August 2013 the time they destroyed our drive ways. Now the canal is just about 4 feet deep i cant jump to my gate. I just pass the wooden bridge of my neighbor. I observe one house about five houses away. Their canal same as mine was dig. But their drive ways are fixed with culvert for easy passage they dont even have driveways cemented previously they are just newly built house. My comment and question: Do i need to guard to be home inorder to catch them digging canal and inorder for me to be able to request for culvert or to request to fix what they destoyed? Do i have to buy that culvert? So that what that beautiful house has should also be provided outside my house? Do i have to have car for them to provide culvert and to return back the concrete drive way they destroyed last year? This digging and destroying our previously functional canal has made us much inconvenience. We experience flooding the time they destroyed our canals on 2013. We just waited when this contractor to fix everything. Can you please have close supervision to the contractors? The location is just above the public cemetery of lubogan toril davao city, houses in front of kristina homes lubogan before bankas heights toril davao city. Thank you

"CFMC-20142028","Good Day. I would like to report my stressful experience with your contractor that is doing work in your road widening project in Paciano Rizal, Calamba City. First, they started working at the front of mu building without informing of what they were going to do. No plans or sketches were conveyed. They did not have a deadline as to when they are going to fininsh their work. They started work last June 22, 2014 and up to ow they have not finished. Second, they destroyed the railins of my building when their dump truck backed-up on it. Their driver only had a students permit. The lawyer renting at the building said the truck should be impounded but tye engineer begged me not to do so so that they will finish their work. I complied with his request thinking they will finish their jobs and repair what they have destroyed to their proper form. Up to now there is hole i front of the building. Third, after the glen do storm, they proceeded to bakc hoe the entrance to the subdivision adjacent to my building ignoring my request they should fill up the hole in front of my building. During their work they destroyed the water pipe serving the whole subdivision. Im exhausted at talking to contractor, sub contractors, pakyawan employees of the contractorswho just point fingers at DPWH and other persons and not own up to their mistakes and take actions to remedy the situation.

It start from crossing bayabas of toril and up to Purok #1 of Lubogan.Were so Glad of that kind of development,because the road widens and it so comfortable for the motorist and thereis no traffic. But one thing that distract us is that they built very gigantic Island that it so high in the center of the road that makes the road narrow again. Anong klasing widening ba ito?,They Just widen the road and then they narrow it again for this gigantic Island sake. nawala na yong since of ""widening "". One thing that makes me bothered is that this a commercial road and more establishments started to sprout along the highway.So sooner or later this road could experience more traffic jams. I recommend that they should built still fence in the center of the road to keep the road wide enough for the motorist and it is not so costly rather than a gigantic concrete Island.

ROGELIO L. SINGSON
Secretary
Department of Public Works and Highways


Kay Secretary Singson:

Magandang araw po sa inyo.

Ako po, isang empleyado ng inyong departamento sa nakalipas na halos apat na buwan, ay sumusulat para iparating sa inyo ang aking hinaing dito sa loob ng inyong pinamumunuang departamento.

Nais ko lamang malaman ninyo ang bulok na sistema ng pagproseso ng pagpasahod sa mga katulad kong Job Order na mas kilala natin bilang J.O. 

Para po sa inyong kaalaman, ako po, at lahat nang mga J.O. dito sa DPWH ay buwan-buwang kinakapos ng pera sa dahilang lagi pong delayed ang aming mga sahod.

Sa mahigit pong apat na buwan pagtatrabaho ko sa DPWH ay ni minsan hindi pa ako tumanggap ng sahod sa tamang petsa (A-kinse o Katapusan ng buwan na nakasaad sa aking kontrata).

Maiintindihan ko pa po sana kung maantala ng isang linggo ang perang tinatanggap ko bilang kapalit ng aking pagtatrabaho, ngunit madalas po ay umaabot ng tatlong linggo na delayed ang aking (ng halos lahat ng J.O.) sahod. Kami po ay istriktong sumusunod sa kanilang sistema at nagpapasa kami ng tamang papeles sa tamang oras.

Para rin po sa inyong kaalaman, ngayon po ay iba na ang sistema ng pagpapasahod dahil kung dati ay mano-mano at sa cashier pa kami kumukuha ng cash na sahod, ngayon ay naka-ATM na Hindi ho ba dapat mas mabilis-bilis naman kung sinasabi nilang automated na? Pero bakit ganito pa rin?

Sa katunayan po ay ang dapat na suweldo namin para sa Hunyo 15-30, 2014 ay hanggang ngayon (24 araw na ang nakalilipas) hindi pa namin nakukuha.

Narinig ko rin po na ang mga J.O. sa accounting ay nakakuha na ng kanilang sahod sa panahong sinabi ko. Magsisinungaling po ako kung sasabihin kong hindi ako naiinggit sa kanila. Ang tanong ko po ay bakit ganoon? Kapag po ba taga-Accounting ay mauunang magsuweldo kumpara sa taga-ibang opisina? Hindi naman po tama iyon.

Marahil sasabihin ng iba na maliit na bagay lamang itong aking reklamo para problemahin ng inyong opisina subalit dito na lamang po ako umaasa na kahit papaano ay matutugunan itong aming hiling. Ilan na rin po kasing mga J.O. ang ipinarating ito sa mga opisinang humahawak sa sahod, subalit wala pa rin pong nagbago. Dagdag pa po ang masusungit na staff ng accounting na ayaw magpa-follow-up. Hindi naman po sana kami palagiang pupunta sa kanila kung naibibigay lamang sa amin ang aming suweldo (na karapatan naming makuha) kung naibibigay nila ito sa amin ng mas maaga.

Wala rin po kaming basehan kung kailan ba matatapos ang kanilang mga proseso, kaya araw-araw na lang po kaming aasa na sasahod na kami. Sana ay bigyan nila kami ng abiso kung gaano katagal kami maghihintay. Para naman masabi ko sa aking pinagkakautangan na sa susunod na linggo ko pa mababayaran ang hiniram kong pera (na nagastos ko sa pagpasok sa trabaho), dahil mededelay daw nang tatlong linggo ang suweldo ko.

Bilang isang ordinaryong manggagawa na umaasa sa sahod para makaraos sa araw-araw (makakain, makabayad ng bills, makatulong sa magulang, makapasok ng trabaho) at pilit na pinagkakasya sana ang maliit na sahod ay labis pong nadidismaya sa sistemang ito.

Napakahirap pong pumasok sa trabaho na madalas ay walang pera, puro utang, at hindi alam kung kailan magkakaroon ng pera mula sa sahod.

Ang nangyayari, sa halip po na kami ang makatulong sa aming mga magulang ay kami pa po ang sinusuportahan sa pang-baon namin sa araw-araw.

Ako po, at ang lahat ng mga J.O. sa DPWH ay maswerte na mayroon kaming trabaho, subalit sa ganitong lagay na laging delayed ang suweldo ay kami, at ang aming mga pamilya ay kaawa-awa. 

Bukod sa nais naming maghatid ng serbisyo-publiko, kami rin naman po ay nagtatrabaho para sumuweldo. Nakakadismaya lang na nangyayari ito.


Maraming salamat po.



Labis na gumagalang,

Applicable lang ba ang policies ng DPWH sa mga maliliit na empleyado at walang kamag-anak within the DPWH? Balita ko rin laging problema ang empleyado na ito kahit saan ma-assign ngunit laging napropromote dahil kapatid naman pala niya and Division Chief ng DPWH-CAR. Isa pa, lagi niyang ginagamit ang sasakyan ng gobierno for his family business. Puwede pala iyon sa DPWH? Kung hahanapin mo naman ang engineer na ito during office hour, nasa bahay nila dahilginawang extension ng opisina niya ang kanilang bahay. Ang masakit, kakutsaba yata ang hipag kaya lahat ng transaction ay nagiging legal as per paper.

"CFMC-20142119","Sec Singson, we would like to inform you of our concern. The Sariaya Heritage Council, Sariaya, Quezon hereby Petitions the DPWH Secretary Rogelio Singson: 1.) On the 19th Century Spanish adobe Masonry at Que-anuang Bridge, we petition the DPWH to save the surviving portions of adobe bricks by altering the bridge's design to let people see this masonry as historical relic. 2) to spare the almost 100 year old Municipal Cemetery of Sariaya from road widening. It was a silent witness to the courage and valour of Filipino Guerillas fighting against the retreating Japanese forces of the 1945 liberation. This Municipal Cemetery of Sariaya will become dust of Oblivion if we just remain silent. 3.) to save the tomb of Briccio O. Reynoso, he was a Quezon Medalya ng Karangalan Posthumous Awardee, the first and Only Quezonian that ever represented the Province of Quezon in International Competiton. 4) to save the 100 year old Kalachuchi Tree and several tombs dating as far as the year 1910 for Ecological and Historical reasons, respectively. They were silent witnesses to the unfolding of Sariaya's History; they are important icons of Sariaya's heritage and history. Let us not forget our Past, let us strike a balance between Development and progress so we may never be condemned to repeat the errors of History.... and We quote: “those who forget the Past are condemned to repeat it.""

However, what makes the situation unbearable is that the flow of traffic is disorganized; and worse is that nobody is manning the traffic. Thus, vehicles are at a standstill for hours. We have reported this matter to the CAR and Baguio City DPWH offices but our concerns fell on deaf ears. Projects like this should be done with the least inconvenience to motorists. We request for your intervention in order to mitigate the sufferings of the motorists and riding public. Check the project site so that you can verify for yourselves how irresponsible and inconsiderate the contractor of this project is. I pass by Marcos Highway every Saturday where road works are also ongoing, but the contractors there are very responsible. Traffic flow is well-organized and the one-way roads are being manned 24/7.

To exit or enter EDSA, there should be an on-ramp/off ramp. As an example, Aurora Blvd should be under EDSA and not the other way around. An on-ramp/offr-amp should be installed to enter/exit EDSA from Aurora Blvd. It would solve a lot of traffic problems, don;t you think?
 

Also, motorcycles should not be allowed on EDSA.

"CFMC-20142165","Good morning Sir/Madam. I am Edna M. Lotho and i would like to complain regarding our sewerage system that the DPWH Blocked. For the past 3 months, ang daan po namin sa sta. ana manila, ay ginagawa, tinibag, binago ang daaanan ng tubig, nilagyan ng gravel and sand. Mula nung gawin po ang daan namin ito, napansin ko na po na bumagal ang pagbaba ng tubig sa amin C.R. Nung pong gabi ng July 28, 2014, at 630 pm, bumulwak ang tubig sa aming daanan ng sewerage na sa may labas ng bahay po namin. Naulit po ito July 29, 2014, at 7am. Sinabi po namin agad sa mga gumagawa na tiga DPWH na nagcecemento ng daan nung mga oras na yon at ang sinabi po namin baka may natakpan na butas na palabas ng sewerage namin. Ito po ang sagot ng tao nyo na foreman daw, ""BUTAS? ASAN? WALA NAMAN AH! Sir/Madm, 48 years na po akong nakatira sa Sta. Ana, ang feeling ko po, ginawa akong tanga kahapon. Sinabihan din po ako na baka sa amin ang problema, yong pong poso negro na pinatignan ko
rin po sa kanila. May pakikiusap na aking ginawa, dahil ayaw man lang nila kaming pansinin. Sa pagkatingin, at gamit ang aming kagamitan, may bara daw pong bato. Pinatignan ko na rin po sa aming asawa ng kasambahay na naggagawa ng poso negro, yon din po ang sabi nya. May nakabarang bato sa daluyan ng aming sewerage system. Sir/Madam, I did not create this problem, but now the problem is in my hands. Also the answer that your people gave, also added irritation to me. Ang sabi pa po sa akin..tawagan nyo maynilad, sila dapat hindi kami, o kaya yong gumagawa ng poso negro. Sir/Madam, for the past 48 years, matino ang daanan ng tubig namin, nang gawin lang itong daan na ito sa M. Roxas St. Sta. Ana, Manila, nagumpisa ang lahat. PLEASE, I DO HOPE THAT AN IMMEDIATE ACTION WILL BE MADE. Also, i have submitted a letter of complaint to our Barangay Chairman. As was told to me yesterday, she will submit my letter to the City Engineer's office. Again, Sir/Madam, an
immediate action i hope will be taken. The fault is not ours,  the fault is with your people. Sana man lang nagtanong muna sila, bago sila nagtibag, kanino po ba ang butas na ito? sa bahay nyo po ba? ano po ba ang magagawa namin para hindi kayo maabala? Wala man lang pong gumawa non sa mga tao nyo! Ni respeto, wala man lang binigay, ang binigay po sa akin, sa aking observation, ay pangiinsulto pa.

    Maharlika highway is our main national highway and therefore with high volume of traffic .a one lane detour will certainly not accomodate the traffic to at least tolerable condition if not comfortable traffic condition.

4. Walang alternate Route para sa tubig na daluyan habang ginagawa ang proyekto kaya nag kakaroon ng baha tuwing umuulan?

"CFMC-20142247","This is to inform the office that the undersigned conducted an ocular inspection together with Engr. Seymour Sotero, Engineer I of this office,Kagawad Victor Saplit and Barangay Tanod Ronnie Willy of Poblacion Tuba on July 4,2014 to verify if our project, Road upgrading (Gravel-Paved) along City Limit-Sto. Tomas Road,K0262+429-K0263+600, Kabuyao, Tuba Benguet contributed to the contamination of the Amliang Creek. The following are my observations and findings, to wit;

a) Water Impounding system (WIS) # 3 (Stage 3) of the Baguio Water District (BWD) which was the 1st WIS we reached along our way. Its source coming from a spring and water along a small creek flowing towards Amliang creek. (pls. see attached pictures).

b) WIS #3 connects and flows towards WIS # 1 (Stage 1) and from this stage flows towards Km. 8 (Filtration stage).

c) According to news, said WIS #3 was previously contaminated due to the loosened soil from the private road opening project that compelled the BWD in filling a case against the concerned people responsible to the effect. (pls. see attached pictures and map)

d) As we proceed along we reached WIS #2 (Stage 2). Its source is coming from a spring and water along a small creek flowing towards Amliang creek. (pls. see attached pictures).

e) WIS #2 has two (2) sub- WIS a & b wherein sub WIS #2a connects and flows towards WIS #1 (Stage 1) and the other directly flows towards Km.8 (Filtration Stage). (pls. see attached pictures).

f) WIS #1 (Stage 1) source of water comes from a spring only and flows towards Km. 8 (Filtration Stage). (pls. see attached pictures).

g)The distances of these WIS # 3,2 &1 apart are 301.99 meters and 213.63 meters respectively. (pls. see attached pictures).

h) Our project is located at the other side of the mountain slope from these said Water Impounding system of the BWD so therefore is impossible that loosened soil from our project contributes to the contamination of it.

i) Earth are being hauled-out from the roadway excavation activities of our contractor although some soil that fell down the mountain slope are unavoidable due to soil erosion along the roadway caused by heavy down pour of rain and needs immediate attention in order to have the road opened to traffic for the public. However, the project engineer assigned thereon constantly reminds and issued site instructions to the contractor instructing them not to the dump earth down the mountain slope. (site instruction and pictures are attached herewith).

j) Besides the three (3) stages of Water Impounding System previously mentioned, there is a Hydro Plant of the BWD located at Camp 6 Barangay. During the rainy season, the source of water of this said hydro plant are Amliang, Bat-og and Kamading Creek but these creeks are dry during the summer moths while other sources comes from spring water located near it (pls. see attached map). The distance of the mountain slope below our project from the BWD Hydro Plant is approximately five (5) kilometers away. Rainwater flowing with contaminants ( Animal waste, chemicals used as pesticides in gardening and small scale mining,etc.) from the tip of Amliang Creek downstream during continues heavy rainfall will contribute to the contamination of the Hydro Power Plant. Water flowing downstream with loosened soil will clear for a long period of time especially if it has a longer distance similar to the mountain slope below our project from the BWD Hydro Power Plant compared to the distances of soil erosions occurring naturally at the mountain slope and the small-scale mining wherein these are located nearer the BWD hydro plant.

Hon. RAMON J.P. PAJE
Secretary
Department of Environment and Natural Resources
Republic of the Philippines
Dear Sir:
xxxx
Last May 2014, the Regional Project Monitoring Committee (RPMC) of the Regional Development Council of MIMAROPA (Region IV-B) visited Sibuyan Island. As member of RPMC, I joined the monitoring and noticed that mangroves were cut to complete the widening and concreting of the national road in Barangay Cagban, municipality of Cajidiocan in the province of Romblon. We were informed that the mangrove clearing and cutting were coordinated with your concerned office.
I understand the predicament of DPWH and the need to address road inundation in the area as the highway crossed a mangrove forest. Be that as it may, all mangrove forests in Sibuyan is protected and in fact an initial component for National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) under Presidential Proclamation 2152:
""Upon recommendation of the Director of Forest Development, duly concurred in by the Minister of Natural Resources, and pursuant to Section 18 of Presidential Decree No. 705, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, do hereby withdraw from entry, sale, settlement or other forms of disposition, subject to valid private rights, if any there be, and establish as Mangrove Swamp Forest Reserves the parcels of the public domain and/or parts of the country, which are more particularly described, as follows:
xxx ¡­ from Malaquing River up to Mabung River at Long. 123¡ã 8¡¯28¡å to 123¡ã 11¡¯52¡å and Lat. 12¡ã 54¡¯23¡å to 13¡ã 00¡ä, from Cueva Point up to Kimartines Point at Long. 122¡ã 55¡¯35¡å to 122¡ã 57¡¯46¡å and Lat. 13¡ã 4¡¯25¡å to 13¡ã 7¡¯19¡å, and from Kabugao Point up to Kabalong Andang Point at Long. 123¡ã 8¡¯53¡å to 123¡ã 12¡¯17¡å and Lat. 12¡ã 53¡¯44¡å to 13¡ã 01¡¯19¡å all located in Burias Island; Basin Island near Burias Island; Sibuyan Island; xxx¡±
We have no idea whatsoever about how your department treats this blatant violation of policies. Granted that the Office of the President has issued tree-cutting exemptions on DPWH¡¯s priority road projects, is it not violating the very own previous issuances albeit the existence of NIPAS law in the light of mangrove cutting in Sibuyan Island. What is the formula and conditions agreed upon by your office and DPWH?
As Sibuyanons, we are glad that the said road is efficiently constructed according to accepted standards but we are still concerned on what needs to be done to avoid further cutting of trees and mangroves ¨C or else, concrete ways to replace what had been cut. We are further concerned, as well, that a number of trees are gradually being cut to complete the widening and road construction in Barangay Mabini, San Fernando, Romblon.
I hope for your kind and immediate action on this matter.","2014-08-19 09:48:10","4",NULL

"CFMC-20142338","Last July 14, 2014 (Thursday) in Mati, Davao Oriental, the Public Information Officer of DPWH Region XI Jose Dennis Flores died violently in a car crash. It seems that the region is disposed to let the case go as if it was an ""accident"" when in fact the black nissan Navarra was driven by Eng. Mark Anthony Sayson who was not a designated driver. Eng. Sayson along with two injured backseat passengers survived the crash but Mr. Flores perished. In an interview of the local police with the driver, Mr. Sayson claims that he was driving at an approximate speed of 60kph and that there was heavy rain which he seemingly blame the crash to bad weather and not to utter human negligence. The deceased PIO of DPWH Region XI, Mr. Flores left his 13 year old son Miggy an orphan since he is separated with his wife. It seems that justice is going to be elusive (or impossible) since the driver has started to claim no accountability to the said incident in a recent interview with the police. Eng'r. Mark Anthony Sayson is a son to Eng'r. ""Sayson Sr."" currently employed in one of the district offices of DPWH Region XI.

"CFMC-20142339","Dear Secretary Singson, I am a private citizen and an entrepreneur who pays taxes religiously so that I can help in my own little way to help contribute in our Country's coffers, some of which are used in road construction and rehabilitation. I live along access road in Loakan, Baguio City. Almost every year I notice that roads along Loakan Rd. are always rehabilitated even if they are in good condition, not withstanding the fact that Access Road which is only several meters from the main road, badly needs rehabilitation. Nasasayangan po ako sa sinisirang cemented roads considering na yung kalye namin ay puro potholes at ang drainage system ay misyado ng silted.I have always believed that the Aquino administration uses funds wisely and I hope your Department can allocate funds for the rehabilitation of Access Road, which is parallel to the Airport's runway. Pag umulan po ng malakas ay baha na po ang daanan. Several times we use our own resources to clean the drainage but we can only do so much as private citizens. I hope Mr. Secretary, you will find it in your heart to do something about our road. We have brought this up with our barangay, but they told us that this is under ATO and DPWH. We don't know anymore where to bring up the concern that is why I am writing this letter as my last recourse. I pray and hope that you will be able to read this letter inspite of your busy schedule and help us with our predicament. The exact address of the road I am referring to is:  Access Road, Loakan Proper Baguio City.  You have to cross the airport.  This road is parallel to the Runway of the Airport of Baguio City and is being used by residents in the area when there are incoming and outgoing planes. This is our alternate road when the Airport is closed.
Thank you and God bless. Sincerely yours, Corazon P. Aquino

"CFMC-20142353","Good morning, My Name is Angelo, a concerned citizen of Davao City. I am grateful that DPWH in our area is conducting road widening for the betterment of our city but I am also displeased with the way things go around. Part of the said project is the widening of roads from Ulas-Calinan, Davao City, District 3. This is more than a comment and it is more likely a complaint. Part of the widening project is to create good water drainage system (riprapping as we commonly say it). Engineers and Contractors contract people to work for them in piling boulders and reinforcing them with concrete cement. There is 10-15 meters(estimated)long riprap work to be finished in each contract. According to the workers, they were disappointed with the compensation system with regards to finishing their job. Their contract rate is higher than what they actually had received after the job. My point here is, how will they be able to find fairness and equality with regards to this? In each contract that they have to finish right away, they only receive 600 pesos/week. How is that even possible? How much does the government spend for the project then? Is this how things happen in the what we call good governance? How come you pay those workers lesser compensation than the average workers? In our area, the minimum wage for each average worker is 200-350. Thats just for the average workers. Lets say its a contractual rate. How come you only pay them 100 pesos or so each day? Do you think this situation creates trust? No it creates anger and fury. Its like the government is cooking us with the same oil we produce. Isnt it possible to implement system that hard/utility workers have to be paid much than those who SIT and decide? Yes people tend to be poor because of lack in education. But thats not the reason why they will receive less than 50 percent of what the average wage they should have. ""right project, right cost, right quality, right on time""? is that what you really mean? ""Daang matuwid, Kaunlaran ang Hatid""? Kaunlaran nga ba? How poor the governance really is. You should say, change should start in each person..how come? when most of your people dont do so. Useless. Please address this to your contractors and people behind the construction of the roads and highways. Remember, we are grateful with your projects but we are not grateful with the things that happen behind your back. One thing, your contractors say that those citizens who had their properties dismantled due to road widening shall be paid accordingly, whats the truth about this? Many citizens say these contractors are liars. How come they promise and ask the citizens to keep Clearances as part of the requirements in the payment and yet nothing happened in the end? Should we call you liars too? Whats the truth behind this? I am afraid that one day the table shall turn. Lapses are too many. Maybe the President of this Republic means his projects and platforms a lot but I dont think his officials do so. Please contact me on the contact infos Ive given. Let us be united in doing all the best we can to promote prosperity and blessing in our country. Thank you.

Today portion of this repaired structure (approx. 100 LM) was damaged again courtesy of minor weather intervention. During year 2009, a mega damaged happened to the dike that resulted into megaflooding, almost submerged the entire town of Botolan and paralyzed all sort of business. DPWH-ZFDEO made massive repair costing Juan dela Cruz millions. Thereafter the above happened again. How safe is the megadike? Why is it always being damaged by just a slight weather intervention?

The contractor and the people who did the quality check should be made answerable and what is disheartening to note is the contractor continue to win projects from DPWH. 

DPWH wake up. You should clean up your image but with the low quality projects that you churn out and the fly by night contractors that you engage to do your projects, nothing will come up right.

I am writing this in behalf of non-permanent workers in this department. According to our contract signed and agreed by the First and Second Party.
“In view hereof, the SECOND PARTY, is hereby contracted.. with a compensation.. to be paid on a 15-30 basis…”.
As such, it is clearly stated that we shall receive our salary every 15th and 30th day (or last working day of the month) of the month. I f this is the case, JOs and employees of this department should’ve been paid salaries on such dates aforementioned, and NOT TO BE PROCESSED ON THE DAY ITSELF OF THE “PAYDAY”. It is our routine to submit DTRs/performance output every 15th and 30th day of the month (same day of the supposedly pay day) for the reason that we have to complete the days covered by those periods )1-15 and 16-30). It is obvious that it is not possible to process our salaries on the day itself of the payday. Result is, DELAYED PAY. Neither it is the fault of the Jos nor the people behind the accounting, budget, and cashier. But, it is basically the problematic “schedule” wherein we have to submit our DTRs/performance output on the day of the supposedly “pay day”. If this has been a common predicament of non-permanent  employees of this department, I think there should be change in the schedule on when we should submit our DTRs, so that there would be enough time for the “minimum of 2-week” processing of our salaries. I am forwarding this concern because I believe and hope that such a problem can easily be resolve if given enough prioritization and precedence.

I tried to reach out to the Municipality of Sariaya office of the mayor and i did not get a reassuring response that the government will take care of the relocation expenses. They said the cemetery may not be affected and the mayor will petition for historical value. That it is a DPWH project therefore we only need a family representative when tombs are relocated. We have been receiving alarming news that it is only my father's tomb left. Will you please give me the facts about this project and what your plans are fir the cemetery? I will appreciate your prompt response and attention.","2014-08-29 15:14:01","4",NULL

To whom it may concern:

I am concerned citizen whom reporting the unscrupulous, immorality and corruption of certain DPWH Dist Engr. named Evelyn Costales, Phd assigned at 1st dist Ilagan Isabela upon involvement to specific ex contractor( few years ago) who used other contractor license under PCAB license contractor E.S Pua Construction (Eddie S. Pua).  All DPWH projects has been pre negotiated to this person Manuel C. Taguba in lieu of E.S Pua Construction.  The said person whom confirmed her boyfriend to for several months and given millions of projects (approx total P7.8M, 7projects in different areas along First Dist.) just last and to this month pre-bidded).

The immorality as public official in government offices as according to CSC are not deserving to be respected when her boyfriend Mr. Taguba has paralyzed wife at present while the D.E Costales noted as separated to husband both legally married.  They got into intimate moments inside the office of that D.E when all her staff has no reaction since all are paid for commissions,foods and allowances from Mr. Taguba..  Obviously, her newly fully furnished office has been provided by that person ""boyfriend"".  Aside they both nagkakamal ng pera silang dalawa their families are suffering from kahihiyan hence, they keep quiet as this person known for several connections that anytime could trigger miserable life if somebody ibulgar ang baho ng DPWH.  Pagkaalam ko din po itong pwesto pinalitan nia (D.E) ay dahil din sa involvement sa corruption ng dati din nakaupo dun.  Nalinis na sana un opis pero po lahat ata ng nalalagay dun ay nasusuhulan din nitong Mr. Taguba from Head to lowest staff.  Most of the engineers in the said office are playing majong inside premises and even drinking liquor during office hour na sagot ni boylet.  

All visitors and even DPWH site project inspectors where fully paid in order to okayed all his projects with DPWH under D.E individually.  How miserable life by all means they connive each other.  Pa pre bid effect pa pro yun po pala nakalaan na kay boylet.  

Sna po in behalf of the boylet family especially kids nakakaawa po pra lang sa tawag ng laman at mkamundong pagnanasa ay sna matapos napo ang katiwalian ng inyong opisyal kababae pa nman makadios pa kuno un pala ay kgrabe makiapid sa taong gusto kumita nakagamit pa libreng oras sa libreng kwarto ng DPWH.  kakahiya po pro nakakaawa po pti un contractor na hiniraman ng license na nagagamit lang sa gnun paraan.  Sna maimbestigahan npo ito sa lalo madaling panahon ng magkarun ng fair competition in terms of projects with DPWH, dignity and kalinisan ng pangalan ng DPWH mapa probinsia o manila.

"CFMC-20142507","Hello. I currently work for a company that is located in a private industrial compound named Grand Asia Compound in Sitio Gitna, Brgy. Tatalon, Valenzuela City. For more than 5 years, the road leading to our office is like a dirt road with large potholes. We were informed that since this is a private road, road concreting should be paid for privately. Last year, the few locators in the compound then pooled our resources to fund the concreting of our road with a budget of Php 3.5M. This week however, a contractor named TOKWING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY started breaking our road using a backhoe. They are claiming that this is a project of DPWH to create drainage. There are no permits shown in the work area therefore we do not know what this project covers and the duration of which. There are also no DPWH representative in the area. I would like to verify if this is indeed a DPWH project and if so, what is the jurisdiction of DPWH in a privately owned road / area. I would also like to verify the coverage of the project if it includes the return of the private road to its previous condition which in concrete and how long will this project take. Your reply via email is very much appreciated so I can show and report this to my boss. Marites Samson

There seems to be a scheme amongst barangay captain of SanPedro, a “prominent couple” doing business in the area and DPWH personnel (who is handling this project). Because the residents are well aware that the previously assessed location of the bridge will be far away from the crossing, BUT it appears that the previously assessed location was not considered here because the future site of the bridge where they started the construction is right at the heart of the crossing/intersection. This location will not fix traffic problem but rather it will create more bottlenecks in the area. Hope that you will take serious action on this matter.

Thank you and more power. May your style of governance be replicated in also agencies and if that happens, the ""tuwid na daan"" of Pres.Pnoy is realizable.

"CFMC-20142545","Please check if the construction of bridge in Brgy. Cabuluan, Sta. Elena Camarines Norte that collapsed last night is following the time plan because as a resident there, I always notice that no one is doing anything for many months that passed. There are just about 3 to 5 working on that bridge everyday and they are even doing the crashing of removed concretes to extract the reinforced steel for junk sale. Whoever is the contractor in that bridge, they are not working on it, it is not the pace of construction for the bridge that has a detour so vulnerable to rampaging waters. Another thing is that they have just posted one or two people in that bridge who are not working at all instead are caressing their fighting cocks. Please replace that contractor and make them pay for this neglect.

Si dir Gregorio po ay nagyayabang na ginawan nya ng paraan na hindi magkaroon ng role ang DPWHEU sa pagpili ng ilalagay sa mga posisyon kaugnay ng implementasyon ng EO 366. Sa pakikipagsabwatan sa mga tiwaling tauhan ng Personnel, Nagawa po niyang abusuhin ang reclassification of positions sa BOM upang di na dumaan sa Central Selection Board ang mga appointees sa naturang bureau.

Sa kasalukuyan, pinapatupad ng dpwh, Zamboanga City ang Road Widening dito sa Barangay Baliwasan, Zamboanga City. Isa po sa matatamaan ng nasabing proyekto ay ang bahay at lupa namin. Hiningi po namin sa DPWH na kung puwede sabay nilang bayaran ang aming lupa at bahay ngunit ang sabi ng DPWH bahay lang daw po ang unang mabayaran. Ang masama po, pinipilit po kami ng DPWH pirmahan ang Permit to Enter kahit wala pa pong bayad yong lupa namin bagay na ayaw naman namin. Ang sabi po ng legal officer ng DPWH si Atty. Sam Duran, pag ayaw daw po namin pumirma mag skip daw po ang proyekto sa lupa at bahay namin. Ang tanong po namin, hindi po ba sa loob ng R.A. No. 8974 ang last option na dapat gawin ng gobeyerno ay expropriation hindi pag iiskip ng proyekto? Isa pa po, dito sa Zamboanga City agad agad pinapa bid ang mga proyekto ng DPWH sa mga contractors kahit ang issue ng Right of Way ay hindi pa po cleared.

"CFMC-20142548","Please have all manhole drain checked and revise the design. This is one causes why we have flooding all over the Philippines. Personally I noticed this, take for example the drainage rehabilitation done on A.S. Fortuna St., Mandaue City. Large culverts are already laid down and covered, expected no more flooding but why it did not solve the problem. The manhole drain is very small so floodwater will not go into the drain to the underground culvert rather pass it and flow down to the lowest terrain and flood the area.

"CFMC-20142603","Subject: What is DPWH’s justification for the demolition of Anda Circle, please?
Dear Mr. Secretary, 
Thank you for your relentless drive to purge the DPWH of erring employees who rig public biddings. Your commitment to transform the agency into a model of honest and effective service and to save taxpayer money is highly commendable.
I am writing you because I am concerned by DPWH’s plan to demolish Anda Circle and turn it into an intersection with traffic signals. DPWH seems to believe that Anda Circle is causing congestion. 
In fact, it is the opposite that is true. Research in the U.S. has consistently shown that, compared to intersections, properly designed roundabouts cut congestion.
•      The MythBusters test shows that an average of 385 cars can cross a four-way intersection in 15 minutes. In contrast, 460 cars can cross a roundabout in the same amount of time. That’s an improvement of about 20%. 
•      Studies by Kansas State University measured the flow of traffic at intersections before and after they were converted to roundabouts. In each case, installing a roundabout reduced delays by 20%. 
•      Studies by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that roundabouts cut delays by 89% and vehicle stops by 56%.
As a concerned citizen, I am asking for DPWH’s justification for the demolition of Anda Circle. What studies and findings justify the use of taxpayer money to tear down the roundabout? 
Secretary Singson, your urgent and immediate action on this request will be much appreciated. As stated in the citizen’s charter of DPWH, I look forward to a reply within 3 to 6 working days.
Please email me to confirm receipt of this email. Thank you for your time and consideration.","2014-09-24 10:57:56","4",NULL

Singson, what is the purpose of having to pass the dpwh promotional examination when one can easily be promoted if you are a ""bata"" of the regional director? according to your d.o. the promotional examination is one of the criteria in the selection process for promotion. when you say criteria that only means that if a candidate failed to meet even one of the criterias in the selection process he/she is not qualified to be promoted. then how come there are still engineers being promoted even if they failed to pass the promo exam. just because they are ""bata"" of the regional director.","2014-09-24 10:28:24","1",NULL

na ang pagbabaon ng maraming Drainage Pipes sa ibat-ibang lansangan ay di-sapat upang makaiwas tayo sa pagbaha na dulot ng walang humpay na pag-ulan ng malalakas , tulad ng ondoy, Habagat at itong pinaka-huling bagyong nagdaan dto sa ating kapuluan, ang Bagyong ""Mario"" ....?

Bakit po ?

bagama't ang sangay pang-inhenyeriya ng ating pamahalaan ay patuloy na nagdaragdag ng mga bagong passage bilang mga bagong drainage, ay napapabilis nito ang pag-accomodate sa mga tubig-ulan na binubuhos na napupunta sa mga kanal, hanggang sa umagos itong pababa patungong drainage pipes at mga estero, hanggang makarating sa ilog, bago ito tuluyang makrating sa dagat ....

Nguni't sa isang banda, ay napapabilis rin ang pag-apaw ng ilog na pinagdudugtungan ng ating mga estero, at kapag hindi na nito kinaya ang malaking volume ng tubig na sobra-sobra sa dapat lamang na iangkop nito, ang tubig-baha ay patuloy na aapaw, hanggang sa ang mga tubig ay unti-unting bumagal ang pag-agos, at hihinto ang daloy nito, hanggang sa ang pag-agos nito ay magiging pabalik na sa mga estero, drainage at hanggang sa pag-apaw ng ating mga kanal sa ating lansangan at mga kalsada ........

at dito na nagsisimula ang unti-unting pag-apaw ng tubig at pagbaha....

bakit ito nangyayari ? ang pag-apaw ng tubig sa ilog na ito ?

dahil ang ating mga ilog ay bukod sa hindi na kalaparan, ay totoong mababaw pa, kung kaya't ang tinatayang bolumetriko ng tubig na sana ay maia-accomodate nito, ay hindi nito kinakaya, at dahil nga sa pagiging mababaw ng ating mga ilog , kung kaya't mababaw din lang ang volume ng tubig na maaari nitong i-okupa, na nagiging sanhi ng mabilis nitong pag-apaw, kahit na di pa man katagalan ang pagbuhos ng malalakas na ulan ......

kung ang sangay ng ating pamahalaan (DPWH) ay may mga proyektong pagdaragdag ng mga drainages, sana po ay makapaglunsad din po kayo ng proyektong magpapalalim sa ating mga ilog, upang mas dumami at lumaki ang volume ng tubig baha na mailululan nito... dahil kung lalaki ang water-level volume ng ating mga ilog, magbaha man, ay di na aabot pa sa katulad ng mga pagbaha na tinatamas ngayon sa ibat ibang lugar sa panig ng kamaynilaan ....

"CFMC-20142620","Good day!

I really appreciate for the effort given to my letter against D.E Costales of Ilagan, DPWH that she denied all the allegations thrown to her.

Certainly, she wouldn't admit nor accept those things but the truth will prevail.  As a matter of fact, ""ang baho ng isa damay lahat"" (lahat sila ay nakinabang).  Actually, they are all, until this month celebrating and joined together in all occassions with their office (affairs, celebrations, ect) of this person Manuel Taguba who used on the other hand, also SMT Construction as of this time, if you can check the vouchers recorded under this who received and authorized transactions by the said contractor to Manuel Taguba.  To recap, Taguba's ""Manugang"" -SMT contractor.  He was notified that the ES Pua was disqualified (suddenly, as issued brought out) recently to used the said license for all projects at DPWH.  And what about those text messages from D.E Costales to Manuel Taguba readed by his family member that causes irks ....""you pray""...and also I love so much!"" pass 9pm dated ___? and other previous messages.  What these connotes?   All are poison to her management and well admired bla bla?  Oh really, gosh!  

Lahat sila po ay nakikinabang sa taong ito from meal to personal expenses of anybody in office, here, if you can check canteen at DPWH list of employees meal paid of Manuel Taguba in lieu of all projects given to him?  What about visitors and bid committee members he also provided food everytime bidding he took and pre negotiated dealed projects given to him?  What about the ""lechon baka"" - a demanded gift to her married ""anak"" last month to Manuel Taguba?  The cash gifts given to 3 Project inspectors from Manila to certain projects of Manuel Taguba recently just to pass it without demeanors( punchlist)?  Even visitors of D.E that his boylet too provided meal and accommodations but under expenses of DPWH recorded?  and so forth.  

Of course, those are all negative, against that will lead her and staff not only to big slap issue and immorality but work suspension and/or termination as according to Civil Service Commission guidelines to all government workers mandated that's why they instructed him to use other and spared contractors licence since then.  Very ideal system implemented right?  They earned and given priviledges such that projects involved push through.   As a matter of fact, Manuel Taguba was instructed ""skip' muna daw siya, ska magparticipate this October listed nine projects unahin lang un lima at sa iba contractor muna daw ibibigay (dahil sa issue na nabulgar?) kaya wait lang siya bigyan ulit ni D.E.  She is happily married?  Really, how come, la si husband nasa ibang lugar kaya pala lagi together sila before start ng work, breaktime, lunch breaktime and til uwian time.   Laughs,  I can't imagine.. Why is it the investigating committee should use civilian spy to know the real issue behind the all allegations made/thrown to her ""love, admire......management? Ulk!  Those talks and negotiations where indeed louder than everything escapades here.  Manuel Taguba always stayed there inside her office talo pa nga niya empleyado araw araw andun siya uuwi babalik.. Ksama sa lahat ng okasyon pa..tagabayad ng lahat ng expenses nila.  Napakaganda nga denial queen epek niya mga bosing.

Lahat sila nagsusugal sa office tama pati inuman ng bigla merun ngcomplain kaya ngmemo kuno si D.E at dina sila ganun ka frequent maglaro.(after months back to usual).  Pwde din po natin icheck all whereabouts ng mga sugalerong staff ni D.E kung nasan during office hour like Arthur na lagi ksama kasugalan ni Taguba kapag di pwde sa office, sa house at kung sinipag pa at maalala babalik office uwian time na after that.

One night after office hour, the newly auditor there as coded ""bading"" kagaling sa kantahan sa folkhouse at si D.E todo kanta kay boylet ""kahit matanda na sila pa rin"" ....then everyone DPWH staff's laughing all the while.  Simplehang garapalan at bulgar di po ba?Napakaraming okasyon sa DPWH tulad sa resort nearby na ginanap at si boylet andun nagprovide ng lahat inumin pag kain ng mga taga DPWH as ""pakikisama"" daw un at SOP bilang contractor (di pa nman makakuha si boylet ng license sa PCAB, feeling gnun na dhil sa mga hiniraman ng license).    Napaka selosa ni D.E kay boylet niya even phone calls galit siya at usapan nila ay di nalayo sa usapang may relasyon, the boylet decide and dictated for her too kaya lagi nakabantay talo pa bodyguard.  Kung merun lng CCTV kakanta HULICAM ang tagpuan galaw lahat ng dalawang ito sa loob at labas ng opis kasama lahat ng kausap na mga empleyado dun hanggang sa Accounting Section.  Nakarecord din dapat lahat ng IN and OUT sa opis na stated dun Manuel Taguba daily guard on duty records.  Unless shut up and deleted na din.  Pro kung merun po taung mg spy at mg video kita lahat yan.  Unknown to all in that DPWH office ang ipapadala mg imbestiga ayos na ayos po ang lahat ng allegations.  Tikom kasi mga staff niya na naambunan.
 
I presumed that this letter are confidentially kept and secretly investigated with civilian spy of DPWH to trace all corruptions and immorality between them.  For security reason ko po din kung ibibigay ko pa po lahat nalalaman details ko sa knila at tiak po akong malalaman na nila ang identity ko po as complainant/concerned citizen na ngmamalasakit sa pamilya ng Taguba na iniputan ang wife na paralyzed  in just...in behalf of project earnings given.  

Nakita nabasa ko po un sinabi ni D.E na lahat ay big LIES.  Shes working in government yet behind nabahiran ng ganun gawain sa ilalim ng pamunuan ng DPWH.  Eleven percent (SOP nila ) of total projects costs per project ang deal lang po nila dati sa boylet but more than that pti sarili kasama na.  Kaya hatian hay naku kagaling sobra.  Napakaraming mystery sa office nia po where usually boylet stayed even sleep sa pgod after session nila.   A resting place and lovenest.   Kaya  boylet used to renovated the office.  Di pa nga daw nakakolekta la pa daw budget.  Team mate sila po..  Pati adjustment hocus focus sa project details nadinig din sa usapan.  

Yes, aside spy, CCTV will be a great help to justify and clarify things...plus the guard records daily and all transactions under those contractors lended of Manuel Taguba who authorized all transactions/projects NOA, NTP recipient, in behalf--SIGNATURES of him could not deny it.   In every sealed envelope of bid docs submitted handed naka affix lahat ng pirma po ng iisang tao gumamit ng lisensia ng contractor na walang iba Manuel Taguba... la po kilala or even connections ang mga nsabing contractor na ngpahiram kay Taguba sa taga DPWH under D.E Costales ni mukha nga nila di nakita dun o uma appear sa bidding kundi si Taguba lamang.

I suggest na mgkarun ng revision enhancement ang Accreditation policy ng DPWH sa mga contractor na kung saan matrace ang nagpapahiram or authorzed attendee sa bidding.  ""TUNGO SA DAANG MATUWID' ngkanda liko liko na, nalihis sa perang nakakamal ng ganun ganun na lamang.  Tingin ko po la na ata konsensia.  Nagpapa feeding program pa siya eh pagtalikod ayun sila dalawa po.

Unfair sa other contractors before pro ngayon po nagkarun na ng puwang makakuha ng other contractor makaiwas issue nlang KUNO pro dhil sa DENIAL effect ni madam at sa boylet...di po ata fair na di maibentigahan hanggang sa dulo ang mga pangyayari nabulgar po.  DEEP and thorough investigation hence requested for fair and justice.  After this revelation lets again hear the result of the Civilian SPY, records in Accounting as well as guard on duty and so forth in related to this case. Bid TRANSPARENCY, revamp and good moral value still best.

Again, I presumed that this letter will not be forwarded to D.E and staff not only for security reason that boylet will really threaten my life but also endanger my kids as well later on.  Pakiusap.   Ang sa akin po kaayusan, katarungan, karapatan ng bawat isa nawa maibigay ng sapat..tungo sa ankop na manggagawa ng ahensiya in service and leadership.  I suggest  also not to take her leave of absence while investigation on going ksi nga po di mahuhuli ng isda.  Isang kumpas lang ni madam tumatahimik na paligid papanu pa po makakakuha ng exact data.  Maybe will attend other bid committee without her knowledge na dun mtrace un specimen signature ng representative na nka affix sa lended contractor and everything (vouchers/documents/cheques).  Definitely malinaw makikita yun.  

Hoping all revelations here were kept confidential and security reasons of the person will be given consideration too.

God bless and more power.

Note:

The investigating committee or team of DPWH can include the lifestyle check of this D.E Costales also the banning of the person boylet MANUEL TAGUBA to join in all bidding and or participation in all activities in DPWH offices or premises such that to avoid all negative issue that brought corruptions, anomalies and immorality as well.

Thank you

"CFMC-20142624","Dear Sir, This is in line with the implementation of EO 366 otherwise known as the Rationalization Law: I would like to make known to you that there may be some abuse of discretion regarding the filling up of positions in various bureaus and services, this department. Mr. Zaldy Falejo of personnel Division used Reclassification/Upgrading of Position to enable him to get the chief of personnel Division Position. This scheme do not undergo the usual process in filling up of position as required in DO 59 series of 2011 which yourself signed as guide to be used in the implementation of EO 366. The Reclassification/Upgrading is being allowed by the Civil Service for teachers due to lack of candidates to the position. To make reclassification possible in the DPWH, A DO 35 series of 2014 was made referring to a DO 221 which was signed by Sec. Vigilar long before the EO 366 was conceived, as the basis for promotion and filling up of positions under EO366. As such, Your DO 59 which is more complete is being disregarded now.

The annex part contradict with the DO 35 and Do 221 but the main part of DO 59 which states among others that CTI employees are least in priorities to available positions does not run contrary to mentioned DO's.

"CFMC-20142644","Dear DPWH,

Please address this. I am sure you are the right institution pero . If I'm wrong then, government po kayo, and so you know who has the authority to address this.

It's been 5 or 6 months since I graduated pero nandito pa din tong mga walang katapusang pag sasaayos ng mga tulay sa Calamba.

Tanda ko pa na hinahatid sundo ako ng magulang ko at lagi nila tinatanong kung ayos na ba daw yung tulay na ginagawa. lagi din ako nallate sa kalse dahil sa trapik na dulot nito. 

Pero noong Abril pa po iyon. Oktubre na ngayon.

At hanggang ngayon, hindi pa din ito tapos, at dumami pa ang mga ginagawang tulay.

Nakakabahala na. Ilang months na tong ganto. Ang dulot ay matinding trapiko. Naging bestfriends ko na ang mga driver ng rutang CALAMBA- UP COLLEGE, Sta Cruz at San Pablo. Ang dami ko na din nakakwentuhang Engr na nakasabay sa jeep. Napagkwentuhan na ata namin ang buong talambuhay namin sa sobrang bigat ng trapik na dulot nito. Yung mga ENgrs na nakausap ko dismayado. Paano ba naman, wala pa atang 15 ft o 20 ft ang haba ng tulay na ginagawa at hanggang ngayon hinuhukay pa din?? 

Naiintindihan ko naman na bahain ang ilang lugar doon. Kasi nakalusong na ako doon. Pero normal pa ba ang tatlo hanggang 4 na oras na byahe mo mula Calamba hanggang San Pablo? o UP College hanggang Calamba?

Lalo na kung rush hour. Aba naman ho, may unibersidad ho kasing malapit doon, ospital, at munisipyo. Mamamatay na siguro ang nasa ambulansya kung dadaan doon. Sana eh lumilipad na lang ang mga ambulansya.

Yung mga driver ho, lugi na agad sa krudo palang. At ang masaklap po, paunti na ng paunti ang byaheng San Pablo dahil po sa krudo palang lugi na sila. Hala, paano na yung mga uuwi? 

At given na napakadelikado ho ng paligid lalo na sa mga lugar na madilim, aba madami na ho kaming nanakawan at naholdap. eh paano ho kung 7pm tapos ng klase namin, edi mga 10 na ho kami makakauwi? mas delikado.

Ipinagtataka ko ho, bakit walang aksyon ang lokal ng Calamba.

Hindi naman ho ako taga doon pero parati ko ho kasing dinadaanan yun. wala ho akong choice.

Sana naman ho ay bigyan pansin nyo ang mga gantong gawain. Iilang dipa lang naman ho ang ginagawang kalsada, bihirang bihira ko ho makitang may gumagawa noon. Bat ho yung sa Magallanes interchange, 8 months daw ho ang rehabilotasyon pero isang araw o dalawang araw lang ang dinulot na sobrang trapik?

WAG nyo naman ho sanang ipagkalat ang muka ko at pangalan ko. Concerned citizen lang ho ako. May karapatan ho akong itago ang pagkatao ko. Ayaw ko hong dumami ang friends ko sa facebook.

Salamat po.","2014-09-29 14:01:54","4",NULL

This CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY slammed the phone on me while I was making an inquiry last August. It all began when I asked her if she could fax or e-mail a form. However, CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY insisted that it is not DPWH policy and told me I have to come to the DPWH-Western Visayas Regional Office to get the form. CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY even had the guts to tell me that people who have multi-million peso transactions come over to her office to get the necessary documents. Doesn’t the Aquino administration pushing for efficient and prompt government services and curb the inconvenience to the Filipino people? Transactions can be made via phone, mail or the Internet. I don’t need to go and waste jeepney fare and my time just to get a document that can be sent to me. And besides, financial transactions are made daily via the Internet or via phone. Even international bank transactions are made that way without people flying from one country to another. I was following up on behalf of someone, whom I should say does not want to deal with the bureaucracy of government offices and arrogant government workers like CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY. I urge your office to reprimand CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY, an arrogant DPWH-6 worker who thinks Filipino people like me are her slave. To remind you and to remind CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY, people like me are the ones who pay your salary. I pay taxes.

Regional Director-Western Visayas
Department of Public Works & Highways (DPWH-6)
Iloilo City

Dear Sirs:


I would like to call your attention about the arrogant conduct of CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY, who is assigned at the Accounting Division of DPWH-Western Visayas Regional Office in Iloilo City.

This CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY slammed the phone on me while I was making an inquiry last August. 

It all began when I asked her if she could fax or e-mail a form.

However, CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY insisted that it is not DPWH policy and told me I have to come to the DPWH-Western Visayas Regional Office to get the form.

CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY even had the guts to tell me that people who have multi-million peso transactions come over to her office to get the necessary documents.

Doesn’t the Aquino administration pushing for efficient and prompt government services and curb the inconvenience to the Filipino people?

Transactions can be made via phone, mail or the Internet. I don’t need to go and waste jeepney fare and my time just to get a document that can be sent to me.

And besides, financial transactions are made daily via the Internet or via phone. Even international bank transactions are made that way without people flying from one country to another.

I was following up on behalf of someone, whom I should say does not want to deal with the bureaucracy of government offices and arrogant government workers like CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY.

I urge your office to reprimand like CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY, an arrogant DPWH-6 worker who thinks Filipino people like me are her slave.

To remind you and to remind CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY, people like me are the ones who pay your salary. I pay taxes. 

Since CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY has the audacity to disrespect a journalist such as myself, how much more of an ordinary Filipino?

CATHERINE “KAT-KAT” BENDOY has no place working for DPWH-6 or any government service.


Sincerely,

This temporary structure temporarily used as the bridge (as detour) while the project is under construction was destroyed by Typhoon ""Mario"". Is it true that the project cost is 10 million pesos? After 45 days (August 31,2014), it is only 15% completed, considering that the duration of the project is only 100 days (should be completed on October 22,2014)? This is the fastest way to reach the town of Santa Elena. Please help the people of Santa Elena by showing the Department's concern on their plight. For the public school teachers working in barangays near Quezon/CamSur and their pupils/students, it Is not easy to walk on that portion everyday just to reach the school.

Yes, it'll be great for that bridge to be fixed since it's old and it needs to be reconstructed but does it really take that long for a short bridge to finish? 5 months or more? I don't really know ma'am/sir. But since the day that I started attending school at NEU which is last June, up until now, the bridge isn't done. I'm sorry but I am not impressed with the slow progress. Because of this, I have to leave the house earlier than usual for me not to be late in school.

"CFMC-20142724","Good day! Inquire ko lang po kung saan at paano mag brought up ng complain regarding sa underconstruction road sa lubao, Pampanga (road stripping). We had an accident happened last Sept 28, 2014 there at Lubao Pampanga due to the road reconstructing without underconstruction signages or any safety precautions. Dinala kmi sa St. Joseph of Remedios Hospital, the nearest hospital where the accident occurred. Para mbigyan kmi ng first aid. We confined there for 1 day. and theres a medical abstract for your reference. Then we decided to transfer at Makati Med dahil taga Manila po kmi na naghangad na pumunta sa Zambales. And sad to say from the date of accident until yesterday we were suffered to some injuries. That's why ngayon lang kami nkapagcomplain. For further information and details you can reach me at my contact number or send an e-mail regarding to this matter. I do believe on our saying "" daang matuwid, kaunlaran ang hatid "" Kaya alam naming na matutugunan niyo po ang aming complaint. I hope for your immediate response and support in this case.

"CFMC-20142725","Dear DPWH,
These are photos of the Tarpaulin Signage posted at the location of the project.

ýWe am complaining against ANORE Construction, whose personnel are working at the site.

Items of complain:
-working without plans
-working without permits
-no safety signs
-no management of precaution and order, ie. negligence of leaving part of the riprap open, cause of flooding into our compound, to properties (house and vehicles)

Weý are complaining also about the design of the riprap being excessive and posing security hazards.

The present riprap is still in good effective condition. Needs not to be re-installed.

The photos attached will show that project in particular is indeed a DPWH project.

Please do not ignore. It is understandably natural for us to divert to higher or private agencies to seek support from, if it will not be categorical the response from DPWH.

Best Regards,
Bryan Fojas

"CFMC-20142734","Dear Madam/Sir; This letter is in behalf of the Camella Homes 5 Homeowners Association Board of Directors and in relation to the on-going project of DPWH-NCR/Las Pinas-Muntinlupa Engg district, in particular, the REHABILITATION OF SLOPE PROTECTION OF NAGA CREEK in Pulanglupa Dos, Las Pinas city. In this connection, we would like to know the status of the said Project located in Naga Creek in Pulanglupa Dos, Las Pinas city. To-date, we have noticed a significant increase in the contract amount from the original P5.0M (as presented to our BOD prior to commencement date) to P8.4M which is now displayed in the billboard installed at the project site. We have noticed lately that works at the river wall along the perimeter of Camella Homes 5 Subd has come to almost standstill. We have been informed by site workers that they will soon start work along the Naga Creek wall opposite the Camella Homes 5 stretch and along St Joseph's Subdivision. Also, information we have gathered show that the remaining rehab works (i.e., demolition of old wall and construction of new structure) of the wall along Camella Homes 5 will not be pursued as originally planned. Instead of the original works (which was presented to our Board of Directors before the start of the project), only repairs of the remaining stretch of dilapidated wall will be carried out this time. We will appreciate it if you will kindly enlighten us officially of the current status and the remaining/revised scope of works of the above-subject project. May we just mention in passing that last Sept 19, 2014, heavy rains caused f lash flood at Camella Homes 5 and nearby communities. On that occasion, flood waters rose quickly and fortunately went down quickly too - both due to the unfinished status of the river wall which allowed quick ingress and egress of flood flows from the creek. We look forward with appreciation for your favorable action to this request. C.

"CFMC-20142736","Good evening, I would like to make an appeal regarding the overpass in Luzon Avenue in Quezon City. Too few of people use it and there are people who cross the road instead. It is probably because the overpass has a foul smell and there is a lot of garbage around. The problem may not only be that but it also has stagnant water which may cause dengue to the people who use the overpass. I suggest that the government must have a proper cleaning of the overpass and it must have a hole in the sides to avoid stagnant water or other ways that are more effective to avoid such problem. I also suggest that people who cross the road instead of the overpass must be strictly restricted and be put into operation. I do hope Sir and Ma’am that you could hopefully take action on my request.

From what we heard, the project commenced on a budget of over P4 Million for roughly 60 meters long and two meters wide repair. We never saw heavy equipment that would perhaps make their works easier and faster. It's been three months now and all that is done would not even equal the size of half a waiting shed. The main concern here is the health of the residents within the community where the project is being implemented. The pungent smell of the sewer is unbearable. We even had a case of two infants (age 1 and 2 years) who suffered from respiratory problems, mainly because of the smell of the dirty waterways. Let me ask. How long does it take for a 60-meter long and 2-meter wide road repair to finish? Are we putting our taxes in the wrong hands? Thanks and please take time to answer this alarming concern.

"CFMC-20142799","Dear Mr. Secretary, I would like to report to you the character and competence of the person being groomed to become chief accountant of the DPwH central Office. But if you will just interview her, you will find out for yourself that she is not fit for the position. Since she was assigned ( Ms. Puno) to the position as OIC of the accounting office as our accountant Mr. Pumanes have been listed as a missing person in the Yolanda tragedy, The accounting division's performance dived. There were so many returns, Missing documents (SAA's), Double payments of claims (Grace Melocoton)and delayed payments of claims. Despite her being OIC of that office, she is not around most of the time to man her office. She also accumulated personal debt to her subordinates in the amount of hundreds of thousand of pesos which she refuses to pay. Ms Quipit, one of her creditors have resigned under EO 366 to at least recover from the loss due to her non payment of her loan. This is tantamount to harassment as she wont be able to get the loan if she were not using her office to gain advantage. She is also influencing the placement committee to promote her wards. When you talk to her, you will know how inadequate her knowledge to run the office. Please take time to do so as she is boasting of Asec medenilla's support on her bid. thank u very much for your time.

Please fix the c6 road from taytay to bicutan.
This road has so much potential especially in curbing the traffic away from the main roads of the metro.

However, the road is extremely broken and full of really deep potholes. Please survey the road so you can see how intolerable and almost unpassable it has become.

"CFMC-20142831","Dear DPWH Officials and Staff, Good afternoon. I was really bothered and shocked by the fact that the slow road expansion and cementing of R-10 has brought the informal settler back to the partially cemented road (north bound). The news reports are always focusing the worsening road congestion in R-10 by the trucks, but one solution would be to expedite the completion is long overdue and delayed R-10 expansion. imagine, for many years, we are using the south bound lane, while th enorth bound lane, was left by the city govt of manila to flourished and invade the north bound road. Dear Sir/ Madam, the informal settlers are now back in the road you have cemented, why not start opening up those finished parts of the road.? We commuters are so affected by seeing taxpayers money gone to waste. So, now we have to pay again with our taxes those new informal seetlers occupying those roads for them to vacate? Even the local barangays are not doing anything to stop, new shanties sprouting each night. Im so sad and depress, seing these, these very people the informal settlers are the ones, causing the crimes here, th eones causing the garbage piling up. While, we the tax payers, are not even given a chance to have decent roads. I hope you feel our harrowing experience passing these roads, since we dont have any other road as alternate. People are hoping the Pnoy administration also finished this long overdue roa dexpansion. We have suffered long enough.

I am the owner of Tuscany Place in Pandan, Angeles City. Our business was affected by the road construction of Pandan-Magalang Rd. The unfinished shouldering of the road is a big problem entering Tuscany Place and the two subdivisions because of the approach along Victoria St. We, together with the homeowners of San Ignacio Subd. and St. Ignatius Subd.(Phase 2) had a meeting with Bgy. Capt. Jerry Alejandrino last Oct. 3,2014 but no response has been made. Aside from unfinished shoulder, manholes are not covered and so many accidents happened and is still happening along this road. They provide sandbags on the shoulder but every time it rains, the sandbags are being washed out aside from being an eyesore to the public. As taxpayers, we deserve an answer and solution from your office regarding this matter.","2014-11-10 13:28:24","4",NULL

Good day Ma'am/Sir.

I would like to know if the Baybay City, Leyte Diversion Road Project is a project of the National Government or with the Local Government of Baybay. If it is a National Project, how come that the property of my parents and some residents here, were taken without a prior offer to buy the property nor was paid. In addition, a deed of sale was prepared by a lawyer, naming the mayor of baybay as buyer in behalf of the City Government. Why is the mayor, as agent of the city, the buyer, and not the national government? How much would be the fair market value of the taken lots?

If it is a local project, is the local government authorized to do the said act? Is it valid? 

Hope I will get a feedback from you. Thank you for your time Ma'am/Sir.

Bonifacio Drive, Port Area Manila

Thru: Hon. Rogelio L. Singson, Department Secretary
		
Subject:  FOR URGENT ACTION

SIR:
Last February 2014, I had an accident for walking in an unfinished/open sidewalk at Barangay Road going to Puerto Galera High School and National Highway Condura Poblacion Puerto Galera Oriental Mindoro. 

That accident has left me with broken bones in my right ankle and legs. I had four surgeries since then. Titanum implants were screwed in my bones to facilitate healing on my cracked bones and completely broken bones. Medical operations have caused me more than a half million pesos. I was not able to work for several months covering the operations and recovery. My pain over what happened to me has not only affected me physically but to my over wellbeing as person. 

I discovered that the contractor of the said unfinished sidewalk was a relative of the seating mayor of Puerto Galera ( Mayor Christopher ATIENZA Dolor) , ENGR. FRANCISCO ATIENZA. A friend of mine complained to the local government but he was told that the road was already turned over to the local government thereby relieving the contractor of liability and advised him to rather file complaint against the Mayor and contractor here at DPWH.

I have pictures of the open sidewalk for your reference as part of this faxed message. 

I was also told that an accident happened before my incident but no action was made to close it to prevent it from happening to somebody else.

Puerto Galera is a tourist destination yet it is very clear that it’s not safe to the locals and more so to local and foreign tourists.

To aggravate what happened, there was even no lamp post nor signages to alarm or inform the passersby of the open sidewalk.

Honestly, I am complaining to compel the government to close the open sidewalk and obtain monetary damages on what happened to me.

Please update me and let me know if you need me to do anything to close this open sidewalk to prevent future accidents.

I am also considering to file the necessary legal action if this matter is not addressed.

Hoping for your urgent response on this complaint. Thank you,

Atty. Jasmin A. Rodriguez

The re-blocking of the inner portions of Commonwealth may not be appropriate at this point in time as such portions are in good condition. I travel this way everyday and I know very well the highway.

Sir I still wondering why until this moment the said DPWH District Engineer continuously working for the projects with alleged  contractor Mr. Manuel Taguba (p2.8M), whom user of various contractor license.  Like for instance, last November 11, 2014 opening bid worth p2.999M was granted again to him using another license with two (2) dummy ghost contractors.  From Mr. Taguba to avoid tracing again previously used licenses E.S Pua and SMT Contractors.  Again, the same authorized signatory which is Mr. Taguba.  So we can notice here the flow of anomalous practice since the bid has been prenegotiated since then.  Although they skipped for a month of granting him a project but then again he availed.
 
Certainly, we can count on more projects to him with the beloved D.Engineer just for the commission and intimate relationship for while wherein very unfair to other contractors in joiniing such projects with DPWH and the immorality seems nothing here too.  Eventually the family has nothing to do with it but to keep silence.  
 
Similarly to D.E Ubina, whom assigned at Roxas, DPWH case, gained ill gotten wealth thru anomalous projects (with Mr. Taguba) he has several illicit affairs too, one is their casual employee apparently during his term yet until this time they are still in relationship.  What is clear here, most of DPWH  District Engineer who happened to head it are corrupt thru Mr. Taguba connivance.  Considering those presented data and information gathered  I presumed the case should be given attention and appropriate action before it got worst.
Granting him a project but then again he availed.
 
I really sorry but the issue is expanded until Central Office wherein budget has been released and also gained to Mr. Taguba commission deal per project.
 
I still believe in your management and goal to clean up the agency would take time, may God lead you in further investigation for proper and permanent resolution.
 
Thank you and more power.

I would like to follow up regarding the status of issue of D.E Costales and Mr. Taguba involvement in prenegotiated projects anomalies and immorality being brought out in your good office through email since September 2014 to present?

 

Until this time they continuously in connection and nothing new with their project transactions except skipping monthly giving projects to every other month using other ghost contractor’s licenses of the same authorized signatory and representative.

 

Apparently, they’re not afraid of consequences here as they ignoring the scandal issue with them but the flow of corruptions priority while and during her services as DPWH Dist. Engineer, First District management.  Of course, after her assignment maybe she could not have been availed all of these things in her life.  Awesome!  It is really disappointing government official who used to grab all opportunities in lieu of lust and huge amount of commission during term.

 

She is not only degrading the morality of the agency she is now employed but also the reputation of her family and the ""boylet"" as well.  The committed crime continuously expands up with her subordinates, engineers, accountant, inspectors, auditor, et al in all processing from bidding to billing released with corresponding commissions.

 

I still believe in your good office for the prompt, fair and final resolution not to happen again under you management, ""Daang Matuwid goal"" .

Re: Follow up on complaint against FLORDES CONSTRUCTION AND TRADING CORPORATION
I write again on behalf of BOOMTOWN COMMERCIAL, to follow up on the complaint letter filed to your office on 27 November 2014.
To recall, I filed a complaint regarding the negligence of FLORDES CONSTRUCTION AND TRADING CORPORATION in conducting their drainage rehabilitation project, resulting in our entire store's first floor to be keep-deep in flood, and damaging all our products and goods in the process.
Despite sending several demand letters to them, specifically demand letters dated 13 November 2014, and 24 November 2014 respectively, only an acknowledgement letter dated 1 DECEMBER 2014 was sent to us. No further action has been made on their part to rectify this matter and it appears that they do not intend to resolve the damage they have caused. The demand letters as well as the reply of FLORDES CONSTRUCTION is attached to this letter for your guidance.
While a representative from your office recently appeared to conduct an ocular inspection of the area, I would still want to inquire on the status of the complaint, as well as on any succeeding steps that need to be done in order to expedite the same. I further request that any bond or deposit that FLORDES CONSTRUCTION may have with your office be held in abeyance until this matter is resolved, in order to compensate for any damage or matter that may arise out of this incident.

Morning commute for a 2km road means 45 minutes for us, early evening going home to Magalang is basically the same, vehicles slow down, because of roads that were paved but now full of holes and uneven pavements. not to mention that it becomes a big drainage because of lack of sewage drain to the bridge. Have pity on the ordinary commuter - students who have to wake up earlier than usual, workers, market goers, etc. It is not enough that they fill it with gravel every time; accidents caused by sudden stops on potholes and motorcycles weaving in and out of traffic are a daily sight. They say that there is a future expansion or upgrading for that portion of the road, but when will it be, we suffer everyday. at least maintain it for the moment Please help us with our predicament, a neglected road that close to a city and to the NLEX does not look well.

"CFMC-20143039","Dear Sirs; I just would like to inquire about a problem that I just have encountered. As far as I know, in our locality, the supposed ""Allocation for a National Highway (Ipil-Pagadian Z.S) is 60 M. wide"". How come that only 20 M. is being ""utilized"" and that the remaining other 20 M. on both sides were returned to the previous owners for the reason that ""The Department has no capacity yet to pay for the whole strip of 60 M."". Now this has caused chaos & panic on the the part of owners who were supposed to be adjacent to the 60 M. Highway because returned portions were now subdivided by the owners thereby selling such to other people where in short, the owner of old lot who were supposed to be adjacent to the ""National Highway"" are now on the second lot thereby depriving the latter of access to the ""National Highway"". Hoping for your consideration and utmost attention towards ""Tuwid na Daan"". Thank you

Nais ko po na iparating sa iyo ang paghihirap namin na mga residente sa Villareal Hi-way at Navarra Avenue sa loob ng 3 taon dahil sa masamang kalagayan nang daan . Wala kaming angal noon sa pag-asa na maayos ang maikling bahagi ng Nautical Highway. Sa ngayon po, medyo galit na ang mga residente dito dahil sa walang permanenti at parang Band-aid na pag-aayos ng daan na ito.. Ang karaniwang ginagawa ng local na DPWH ay ang pagtambak ng “buga” (rock clay) sa mga naglalakihang butas ng kalsada. Ang “buga “ ay napupodpod pag-nadaanan ng mga malaking sasakyan. Pag-may ulan , ito ay nagiging putik at tumatalsik sa gilid nang daan. Ang butas ay makikita na naman. Pag-sikat nang araw, ang putik ay nagiging parang polbos. Pagdaan ng malalaking sasakyan, naku po!!!!!!, ang kapal nang alikabok. Ang sinabi mo na “appropriate measure was taken” ay hindi angkop sa problema, dahil paulit-ulit lang ang nangyayari. Marami nang truck na lupa ang tinambak lalong dumadami ang putik at kumakapal ang alikabok. Nasa makadaan ka dito at nang maramdaman mo naman ang aming paghihirap. Sa nagdaang tatlong araw ay umuulan ditto at sira-sira na naman ang daan. Sa ngayon lang 3pm, 6 na stockpile na naman ng buga ay kaka-deliver lang at hindi pa man nauubos ang putik ay lalong dumarami. Paki-download lang po ng mga video at nawa ay maawa ka sa amin.

Thank you Secretary for helping us include this infrastructure whatever redesigning will be made as long as it will help the people mostly farmers on the other side of the river. Regards and more power.

Greetings from Sibuyan Island.
Due to queries and complaints we received from our kababayans here in Sibuyan Island, we are requesting for the latest information and ways forward on the construction/rehabilitation/restoration of Olango and Punong bridges in Brgy. Espana, San Fernando, Romblon.

This issue has been raised during one of the meetings of the Infrastructure Development Committee meeting of MIMAROPA Regional Development Council, where I sit down as regular voting member.
Attached herewith are photos of the said bridges which are very risky and dangerous to our people.
I hope for your immediate response on this matter.

To you my dear,
     Dir. Mrs. Elizabeth Pilorin

     Thank you for sending the ten pages of explanation, the repair to bobby. It\'s useless, bob already knows about your explanation.

     You already told me a lot of things with the copy I sent. The evidence is with his hands. The matter of complaint was on the Red Tape. If you showed me a picture, it\'s only a picture but I have a lengthy letter which you did not mention. It was not me who hindered this, right? To tell you frankly, you have made a big mistake. You are trying to insult me for my apparent lack of knowledge.
     
     Its top secret that it went off, is because you are afraid of Drilon and possibly will be said  against the DPWH head, Secretary Singson. Perhaps you are afraid that it may awaken some of the sentiments and construction shall drop in DPWH since you have been designated as the chief of the information division and feedback liaison officer in the DPWH.

     One of the obligations of your office is to publicize the bidding process to all the people of Paquibato who won the ""Dire"" camp Gulones Km. 1-2 to 4 and km 7. How much construction cost which is supposedly in the 3 billion plus ""signage"". Why is  it that they will not mention how much was spent for one kilometer, one billion for Km 1-2 and for Km 4 it reached 1 billion. This was only 350 meters, well for km 7 I don\'t know but the cemented part is only 500 plus. This shows that the project did not reach 2 km.

"CFMC-20150098","To whom it may concern:
My name is Hero Singun and I am sending this formal complaint against what might be a sub-contracted construction vehicle of DPWH that has been involved in a vehicular accident this January 31, 2015.
On January 31st Saturday at around 12:50 PM along Sen. Puyat Gil Avenue near Taft Avenue, a cement mixer truck with the plate number URI 663 bearing the placard “DPWH Project” rear-ended the public utility jeepney I was riding. The said truck massively collided with the aforementioned public transport with the plate number TVY 541 that was on a full stop by the U-Turn slot along Sen. Puyat Gil Avenue. Additionally, the jeep I was on which was on a completely halt, subsequently bumped on another jeep in front with the plate number TWF 240.
As the closest person to the rear of the jeepney, I have closely witnessed the truck going at us without a halt. As such, I was the first person in the jeepney to have received the collision shock and though I have reacted quickly to throw myself further away from the area of impact, I have suffered a very painful back injury.
As the primary witness and one of the victims of the vehicular accident, I can testify with confidence that the DPWH cement mixer truck was clearly responsible and at fault.
This injury might be internal and having an existing history of back pains, I have submitted myself into professional assistance for the thought that this would lead to serious complications.
I am demanding the contracted agency or the department, whoever is responsible for the actions of the truck URI 663 to rightfully compensate me with the personal damages and inconvenience it has incurred upon me. Should a settlement fail to complete within a month’s time this letter was received, I will be pressing legal actions against the truck and the responsible body it is reporting to.
This e-mail is being sent for record purposes. Attached are the images pertaining to the incident and the vehicles involved.

Yours truly,

Hero Singun

Hi,

Could you at least give me the detailed information on the truck and the truck driver? I am sorry but I have all the right to assume that the equipment was under the management or sub-contract of DPWH since a sign of the government department's name was displayed on the truck driver's windshield as indicated in the photo. You may have the justification on all accounts that your department does not have to answer to this incident but I am sure that a certain body has to be responsible as you have mentioned ""the said vehicle may have been used in the implementation of government infrastructure projects elsewhere"".

I appreciate and await your immediate sincere response.

Another problem with using the traditional way of making/repairing roads takes a lot of time, especially in the urban areas in which traffic is present. I am also attaching a video entitled: ""Paving the road of the future"" by Precast Education Florida which may also help explain this Pre-cast Road.

SKYWAY STAGE 3 Dear Secretary Singson, It is laudable for government to serve the needs of the people. Commuters have been suffering from heavy traffic especially during rush hours and also during the months of November to December. But it seems that heavy traffic within Metro Manila is now an all year round occurrence. Our streets are not expanding but our population and vehicles on the road are growing yearly. The project of your department to link the SLEX and NLEX is a very good undertaking and our company fully supports it since we use both toll ways to reach to our client-schools. Last year when several DPWH surveyors marked the site of where to place the posts or supports of the Skyway Stage 3, particularly posts PS3-64 and PS3-65, these posts are marked directly in front of our office lobby and main warehouse garage. As the Skyway Stage 3 project will obstruct our building along G. Araneta Ave it will also obstruct the normal flow of our business. May we then request that the mentioned posts be moved or adjusted in a way it will not impede our normal business operations? We are hopeful for your favorable reply. Thank you very much. JORGE A.

"CFMC-20150109","Dear Secretary Singson,

Pls find attached pictures of the national road located near Passi City, Iloilo (Passi City to Calinog), as you can see it is badly maintained and as a frequent passerby in this area for so many years now, I find it unacceptable that your agency with the biggest budget allocation cannot fix this 200 meter portion of the road. Ang tagal na pong ganito ang sitwasyon ng daan na ito. Hindi lang buwan kundi taon na ang bibilangin.

Pls take note also that there is only 1 road but two bridges. Funny eh. The bridge on the right was completed 2 years ago but until now, hindi pa nadadaanan ng sasakyan. Kaya nga nagpatayo ng bagong tulay kasi 'yong luma ay may edad na at hindi na safe daanan. Hintayin pa ba natin na may aksidente na mangyari at may mawalan ng buhay dyan before we take action???. The problem w/ your regional director puro photo ops ang ginagawa...laging nakangiti kung kasama ka, si Sen Drilon, si Presidente. I would like also to bring to your attention the portion of the highway from Iloilo to Kalibo...sa probinsya po ng Capiz, it is one of the worst highway sa buong isla ng Panay na nadadaanan ko. Madadaanan din ng bisita natin sa APEC. Nakakahiya kung ito ba ang klase ng highway na madadaanan nila.

Your immediate action is really needed on this. Patulog-tulog sa pansitan ang RD mo at mga district engineers dito.

6.2 Obstruction within ROW

February 3, 2015 Sir, Good Day! Sir, We have acquired a property in front of Brgy. San Jose, San Miguel, Iloilo last Oct. 2014, a house and lot. The property is situated along San Miguel, Iloilo national road. In line with this, there is somebody ( Mr. Delfin Guelos ) who rented our frontage , 4 by 10 meters which part of national highway. I would like to inform your good Office regarding this case and ask your help regarding this matter. His planned occupancy on our front area would cause nuisance since that area is our right of way to the national highway. I hope that on this matter Sir you could shed light to us regarding our right of Public Convenience to our National Highway. Very truly yours, GLORIA P. LEGARDE San Jose, San Miguel, Iloilo","2015-02-04 11:32:07","5",NULL

Nakipag-ugnayan po kami sa Tanggapan ng DPWH dito sa 3rd District ng Laguna, kay District Engr. Pol De los Santos ukol sa status ng construction ng nasabing tulay at sinabi nya na Bridge Maintenance Division, DPWH National Office ang may hawak nito. Dalawang beses na po itong napaTELEBISYON at kinukondena ang mabagal at hindi matapos tapos na construction ng nabanggit na tulay. Marami napong aksidente ang nangyari dito at apat na pong katao ang namatay at ang huli nga po ay nitong nakaraang linggo na nahulog sa ilog ng ginagawang tulay ang isang tricycle dahil nawalan ng kontrol at namatay ang isang pasahero nito.

"CFMC-20150154","Congratulations and Commendation to DPWH in expediting the road widening project in the R-10 (Pier ) area. What a relief~~~ The traffic is way much better and faster, since they opened the north bound lane of R-10. From the Delpan bridge to Moriones, the newly cemented road, was finally opened to vehicles, decongesting the sout bound lane. We hope the on going road cementing in the north bound lane from Moriones to Navotas, to be totally cleared of informal settlers, so that the traffic will even faster. Hope the center island lights be opened soon since it is dark at night. And may I suggest, that we use the many stone barrier used during Pope Francis visit to Manila, instead of being lying unused in the navotas area? We could use to to mark a lane for private vehicles (just like the lane markings used for pope Francis vehicle) to pass through, specially during rush hour, as the drivers of big trucks still are not discipline enough and occupy all lanes, and the ones causing the traffic even after the opening of the north bound lane. The cement road barrier can at least give a sole lane dedicated for private cars, to breeze from roxas boulevard to c4 or Navotas area. once again thank you very much for making lives of people better, specially thos eplying this route, Its great alternastive route to the north. sincerely joey lateo

"CFMC-20150167","Good afternoon, I tried to send this through the feed back page on your website but I kept getting an internal server error. Good afternoon,

I would like to share an event that took place today in Matalom, Leyte about 10:30am January 28, 2015, that involved a construction project site on the national highway. Unfortunately I was involved in vehicular accident on the site of one of your contractors. Fortunately the accident was not very serious (no loss of life) but I believe this could have been avoided. Before entering the area (the stretch of highway where work is being performed) there were no warning signs. I spoke with some of the residents who live in the area and this was a great concern with them as well because there are a number of children in the area. Another issue was the debris on the highway. The gravel left behind on the road is what actually caused my motorcycle tires to lose traction resulting in the accident, a local resident helped me and picked up my motorcycle and moved it out of the traffic lane on the highway. I spoke with several different drivers (PUJ and Tricycle) today and they complained about the same problems. After the accident I called my husband and told him what happened and to come to the scene. After my husband arrived, the driver of one of the trucks placed one yellow warning triangle about two meters behind the trailer of his truck which was parked about 10cm away from the highway lane itself. An action such as this shows the driver of the truck knew he was wrong so he quickly put the warning device out before the manager arrived. A few moments later the manager and his assistant arrived. I must say I was surprised at the way they spoke to me, not only did they start to speak aggressively and loudly at me they also angrily told me how wrong I was about them putting warning signs out for the other drivers on the highway. Not one time did they ask if I was ok or showed any compassion even though I was standing there bruised and bleeding. They treated me as if I was beneath them, not worthy of speaking to them and offended that I dare ask them about warning sings. I called the police to come for my safety because of the hostile behavior of the manager and his assistant with the backing of the construction crew. My husband asked why there were no warning sings placed and why did they not remove the debris from the road, the assistant said \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the Philippines, not America\xe2\x80\x9d I could not believe he said that. I am a Filipina proud of my country and countrymen, his statement suggests that because we are Filipino we are somehow inferior to Americans, as if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to follow rules, I do not share his opinion of my country and my people, I sincerely hope the DPWH who employs this contractor does not share his opinion either. I asked the manager to put warning signs out then he said to me \xe2\x80\x9csee you in court\xe2\x80\x9d as he walked back to his truck. Shortly after the police arrived and I explained what happened. The police officer agreed there should be warning signs in the area for approaching drivers he also mentioned the debris on the road. The police officer asked the manager about the debris (gravel and mud) on the road and he said they did not put it there even though they have the only construction equipment in the area. I drive this stretch of highway two times every day as well as many local drivers, we all say the same thing, the debris from the road is obviously from the construction site, it was not there before they started the work here. After the police spoke to them they agreed to put warning signs on the highway and the assistant manager said to the workers \xe2\x80\x9cmen at work\xe2\x80\x9d while laughing and poking his index finger into the palm of his other hand which we know to be an obscene gesture. Today is a day that truly saddened me, to be treated at a level of disrespect that is absolutely unwarranted and unacceptable in any circumstance especially from a company contracted by the DPWH which is a part of the government of the country that I love. I sincerely hope the DPWH does not condone such behavior from its contractors and will take proper steps to ensure their contractors treat our fellow citizens with dignity and respect that we all deserve. Thank you for your assistance and God bless.'","2015-02-05 14:55:47","4","8"

Dear Engineer Limpengco,

I am writing this letter for your Office to conduct an Immediate assessment and technical inspection of San Vicente/Calendola Bridge located at the boundary of Brgy. San Vicente and Brgy. Calendola here in the City of San Pedro, Laguna. This is in order for us to determine the actual load limit/allowable load limit of the said bridge. The said bridge had undergone repairs on the previous months of this year. After the repair we had asked for the load limit specifications in order for us to limit passage of Buses and big cargo trucks and to avoid over loading thereby causing damage in the future. But up to this date there was no official communication  from concerned government agency that will address this concern. We are also in constant communication with the Office of the City Engineer of San Pedro but they cannot provide us with the needed information. They are also waiting response from your office.

Let me just brief you of the Geographical location of the said bridge. This is strategically locate as the entry and exit points of the upper barangays of the City of San Pedro, the Province of Cavite passing thru the town of General Mariano Alvarez and an alternate road going to Daang Hari. Any damage that will occur in the future will greatly affect mobilization of the populace passing thru San Vicente/Calendola Bridge.

Once again in behalf of the people of Barangay Calendola and other concerned motorists and commuters catered by this bridge, May I personally ask for your immediate assistance in addressing this urgent concern.

More power and GOD Bless,

"CFMC-20150220","To Whom it may concern, Sir please look into the construction of the Calumpit Bridge. Who is in charge of making sure that the beams used for the construction are of standard grade. I look at the beams and they seem weak and crooked as I pass by everyday. 
2/27/15
Dear Sir: I have sent an email regarding the bridge construction at Calumpit, Bulacan which has been delayed so many times. My concern is about the quality of the beams the construction company is making. They appear crooked and inferior. I am able to see them while driving at the road and the beams were being made by the workers at the road which exacerbates the traffic and poses danger to pedestrians. Now they have placed tarpaulins to hide them but I can see workers putting cement plasters to hide imperfections. Another thing is the new bridge is lower than the old bridge and I'm afraid that during rainy season the flood waters will reach the beams and cause damage to the new bridge. Please look into the bridge construction and the quality of the bridge they are building. Thank you.""","2015-02-16 10:51:03","5","15"

Attached is a picture of our highway in the 3rd District of Iloilo, Brgy Gines Patag, Cabatuan, Iloilo to be exact. This 200 mtrs portion of the highway, is another example of the inefficiency and incompetence of your people here in Iloilo. Imagine, this road was never repaired for almost 10-15 years now!!!! All they do is put gravel and sand...our brilliant engineers in DPWH can't seem to find a solution to the problem on why the road is eroding whereas 20-30 years ago wala namang problemang ganyan. Kung di nyo kaya ang problema, bakit pa kayo nandyan, ibigay ang pwesto at pasahod ng gobyerno sa mas kapableng engineer!!!

Yours Truly,
The Highway Warrior

I am hoping that there will be changes because we have a lot of new employees reporting to the bureau and hope that they will not have to go through with what we have experienced. another thing is that the payroll team kept on pointing their fingers to another person but none of them were able to let us see if our papers are still with them or not.""","2015-02-25 15:29:46","1","5"

I was asked to follow-up on the status of a billing collection and to comply should there be any other requirements needed for it to be approved. In which I did what I was asked to do and everything went fine. In fact, all the people together with the Section/Unit Heads that I inter-acted with were very courteous and accommodating. And I so much admired the working attitude with the most of them. After all its supporting papers were checked by the ICU officer, the folder/voucher I was tasked to follow-up was forwarded to the Accounting Section. And there, they asked for another requirement wherein I also complied. It is just so happen that the original document will be coming from Manila and so an advanced copy were faxed as the original will be sent via parcel delivery. Sir, I would like to ask for your attention in reviewing the performance of Ms. Evangaline C. Manalo, Accountant III. She is the Head of the Accounting Unit here in DPWH \xe2\x80\x93 5th LED. Among all the officers and staff working in this noble institution, Ms. Manalo is the exact opposite of them all. It is so easy for her to curse at any person whom she finds lower than her position in office. I was one of those lowly people she has raised her voice with as she pointed her finger towards me, scolding me, accusing me and saying so many things that were not part of my purpose of being there. I tried to talk and ask around with other people whom like me, being a Liaison Officer, processes billing collections from licensed contractors with regards to what they can comment about Ms. Evangeline Manalo and we all shared common observations and experiences about her, among them were: - Very unaccommodating - Tactless, curses at people naming them with very unpleasant words - Humiliates other people with rude and degrading remarks - Always frowning and very unfriendly - Unprofessional with her actions as well as with her words - Capricious and very fickle minded - Uncooperative and very difficult to approach Even the people working in DPWH 5th LED can also attest that Ms. Manalo is the most difficult person to work with. I pray that you would give ample attention on this matter sir. And if it is possible, I would greatly appreciate it if my name would be held with discretion when you consider and look into her work ethics. Thank you so much, God Bless and more power to you.

"CFMC-20150313","I am a resident of Tanauan, Leyte, Eastern Visayas/Region VIII. We would like to request that our 6 meter national highway bridge in Solano, Tanauan, Leyte, be repaired at the earliest time as it has been almost one and a half years since it was destroyed by the Super Typhoon Yolanda. At the moment, alternate route is being used by residents of Tanauan and the nearby towns Dagami and Burauen. This route is through the Tanauan market using the almost more than 50-year old Embarkadero bridge, and the ""newer"" bridges along the diversion road of Tanauan, Leyte. As the Embarkadero bridge is almost older than us, we fear that what happened to Hiagsam bridge in Jaro, Leyte could happen to our Embarcadero bridge considering the additional load, of all commuters and vehicles small and heavy ones alike, it is subjected to since after the Yolanda destruction. We believe Embarkadero bridge is also even overdue for check up and maintenance repair. I reckon DPWH is also concerned of depreciation of its infrastructures. We witnessed that there had been work started on the repair of the Solano bridge but it seemed to have been abandoned long before its set completion date of February 20, 2015. There are materials such as hardened cement, steel bars and boulders left at the site. There are already rumors bordering on SOP and corrupt officials concerned on the repair of said bridge. I, however, choose to still count on the honest and concerned service of DPWH, all its officials and employees. It is with this fervent hope that we pray to see that this request merits your prompt and able action as we were informed the request for budget is already at the DPWH Central Office.

I\'m at sea for 30 long years and now tired of being away to my family. I\'m planning to retire in a couple of years. Hope you understand what i mean. I\'m an owner of two (2) adjacent lots with TCT 116577 and TCT 117138 (5000 M2, now less because of Eco Tourism Road)in Barangay Ibabang Talim, Lucena City, Quezon. At the back of my lot was a creek and a river which is now being quaried. Due to ongoing construction of Eco Tourism Road bridge my lot have been submerged by about 5 meters. This 2 lots were very important to me because this is where i plan my livelihood when i retire in a couple of years. Unfortunately these lots WILL NOT HAVE ANY VALUE BECAUSE IT WAS SUBMERGED BY ABOUT 5 METERS OR MORE ONCE THE BRIDGE ROAD IS FINISHED. I have pictures to prove this. I really concerned about the flooding that always happened in our country and the world due to climate change. I\'m a living witness to that when typhoon Frank brought flood in that area. Please help me. I hope the goverment will do something about this. Hope this complain will not fall into debt ears. I do believe with Daang Matuwid of the goverment but i also need your assistance into this matter. I do not have the money or resources to level my lot to the bridge. My lot will be a catch basin once the creek and river will overflow. IT IS AT THE CORNER OF FARM TO MARKET ROAD AND ECO TOURISM BRIDGE. Hoping for your favourable reply which is forthcoming.

Dear Sir,
 
Thanks very much for your reply. However gusto ko lang po na malaman kung ano ang plano ng DPWH sa Barangay road. Patataasin po ba ninyo para habulin ang taas ng approach sa tulay or lalagyan nalang ng ""underpass"" para hindi maharangan ang Barangay road sa crossing. Ano din ho ang hakbang para sa anti flood measures.

Dear Sir/s

This is a follow up of my previous inquiry of what plan the DPWH is working  with regards to the Barangay Road in Barangay Ibabang Talim which bisects the Morong Bridge Eco Tourism Road in Lucena.

Also attached herewith is a Petition letter executed and signed by some of the locals in Barangay Ibabang Talim, Lucena City. We have made this letter to show our concern with this project. Hope that you will look into the matter seriously. 

Sincerely yours,

Renato P. Sy Jr.

Dear Sir,

Thanks for the reply.
Frankly speaking i\'m not agreeable to this project (uplifting of Ibabang Talim Barangay Road). Underpass for me is the best way to have a safe access in  the Barangay road. Small vehicles motorized/mechanical, bicycle, children, elderly and even farm animals from Barangay Ibabang Talim, BarangaySalinas, Barangay Ransohan, Barangay Ilayang Talim and other adjacent rural Barangays  will use this Underpass as a safest access. I have mentioned it from my previous messages the reasons that we are pointing why we are against the uplifting of Barangay road crossing Morong Bridge. 
Yes i have a dialogue with the Project Engineer last March 4 but i did not agree to his proposal. In fact on that same day i have sent my 1st message on the ""Complaint/Feedback form of DPWH. 

They have started pouring stones on the said intersection and we can\'t do anything right now. As a matter of fact some residents are now restless and loosing hope. Yes we know that this is a goverment project and it\'s very hard to oppose especially for the rural people/us.

Sir, I\'m leaving the country tonight June 3 to join my ship in Romania and may not always monitor my emails due to limited internet access on the vessel. I will give you the email address of the ship once i\'m onboard so that you can update me about this matter.The best thing i hope is for this project to address all the needs of the people in the area.

I\'m expecting all the support the DPWH will extend to me/us so that my lot will not be a catch basin of flood waters and to have good ,safe access to it as well. I hope that despite what happens my lot will still be productive when i retire and not completely loose its value. I\'m now leaving with these words...

Please call the attention of DPWH-ISABELA 1st District Engineering Office Director!

On behalf of the the citizens in the Municipality of Santo Tomas and Cabagan, Isabela, I would like to bring to your attention concern regarding the Cabagan-Sto. Tomas Overflow Bridge (see image 1). Said Bridge has been pending for repair since June 20,2013 (see image 2). TEMPORARY repair has been made, but not PERMANENT as we expect. Therefor, it STILL poses immediate danger to the riding public (see images 3,4,5,6,7,8).

Moreover, we would like to inquire with regard to the design of the bridge (Overflow: same design with other bridges in various municipalities in Isabela) since it is easily flooded comes rainy season. We therefore humbly request for the re-design of said bridges as it is vital in the economic development of my town and its neighboring towns.Note that riding though boats (Banka) is the only means of transportation when those bridges are fllooded!

Good Afternoon Sir, May we bring to your attention this on-going project of DPWH along General Luna Road, Baguio City. The project started this morning with the drilling of the main road going up General Luna Road and it is causing too much noise and shaking of the buildings. Because of the noise, employees of the bank could not concentrate and could not even hear incoming/outgoing phone calls and could not also hear the clients. In addition, the trembling brought about by the drilling is making the employees and clients panic, thinking that there's an earthquake. May we then request your good office if possible that this will be done at night time so not to disrupt the transactions and work of the businesses located within the vicinity. Hoping for your immediate action. Thank you very much. Kristine Marquez

"CFMC-20150424","March 18, 2015 7:15 pm To Whom this letter may concern: Pleasant day to you. I am writing to your office due to the following concern: 1.national highway clearing along surigao-agusan del norte road (alegria road section) 2. urgent clearing/removal of our residence fence that is under our patented land and been there since 1979. 3. informal notice since we did not receive any notice from the requesting team from DPWH. Sir/Madam: i have a video record of our conversation/meeting between the DPWH personnel and our mayor and municipal engr. though i don't have an idea where to attached the said video as our evidence of the said informal meeting. they just ask our presence at instant in order to discuss the said road clearing according to the office of engr.Henry Cruz J. Marapao together with engr. edel pejan of DPWH surigao city. to give you an idea our land is along national highway and is a titled private residential land (we have all the legal documents that will prove our ownership and we paid our taxes regularly advance most of the time and we never miss a single payment since we owned the lot and our house been in this land since early 70's around 1973-1974 though we owned the land years before the construction of our house. and our fence in this said land been constructed since 1979 meaning it is not covered yet in the said Road right of way for the national highway. According to our municipal mayor dominador esma jr. that he will claim portion of the land as covered in the Road right of way for some and future LGU's development in the area covered within 15 meters from the center of the national highway to our land/house and according to the group of Engr. Henry Cruz J. Marapao and Engr. Edel Pejan that they will claim the 15 meters with or without our approval since it is covered to the 15 meters.the only affected part is our fence but it is a high-end type of fence. we will obey whatever the government required as long as it is covered within the EO no. 621, s. 1980 amended EO 113, s. 1955. all we ask is that since our fence and our house been built before this Executive order, we allow the DPWH to demolished our fence granting or an exchange that the DPWH will build the same structure after the 15 meters RROW in your/DPWH own financing. but according to engr. Maraparao and Engr. pejan of surigao del norte DPWH their office will not going to finance the reconstruction of our fence since there is no appropriation given by the DPWH national office and i guess they are talking about your office. they are too harsh in explaining things that is why we did the same gesture to them. all we ask is to have some legal basis to know if what they are saying is true. because corruption is very rampant now a days among our government officials and some other LGU sector. the other point is why is it the project of clearing only affects portion near our area? why not like surigo city that everyone is covered and affected? it seems that this DPWN employees will insist that our area will be considered as one of the first batch for demolition. why not start at the boundary of agusan del norte and surigao del norte just meters away from our area? if in the event that what the surigao DPWH engrs been saying that you will not pay for the reconstruction of our fence is true, please give us some government guidelines/executive orders/ and our a copy of approved program of work in order for us to make sure that the said program of work is executable in all areas in the same year baka kami lang dahil hindi kami bomoto po sa aming mayor ngayon. and quite frankly we smell some politics involve in this project? bakit kami lang apat na pamilya lang po ang first e demolish bakit next year pa ang iba? we are hoping for your immediate answer of this matter since we are afraid that the demolition from DPWH people will start anytime soon that is what they told us yesterday. thank you for your time mrs. eden""","2015-03-19 08:27:19","4","6"

The last reply dated January 27 from your District Engineer says: ""After effecting the proper and appropriate coordination with the City Government, the Contractor has already resumed the project implementation and shall complete the project within this month."" Today is March 21 and I want to show you the development of your project. Please see attached files named ""Picture 1 Before"" and Picture 1 Now"" also the files ""Picture 2 Before"" and ""Picture 2 Now"". You can see that there was no development in your project. How can you ""complete the project within this month"", as you claimed? My observation about your project is that, there are numerous projects being implemented in the City of Iloilo simultaneously and you awarded the contract to only certain contractor WITHOUT CHECKING IF THIS CONTRACTOR IS CAPABLE WITH MANPOWER to do the job. You can not see any worker at daytime working in this project, they only comes at night, few of them, and work for short hours then leave. They will come back again after 3 to 5 days to work again because the contractor is pulling them out to work on another project in the city. ""Picture 3"" shows the status of their work 4 days ago...nothing happened after that. I wonder if the district engineer is also checking their work. Does DPWH impose fines to contractor who failed to complete the project on time? surely they have Surety bond before they start the project. We, the taxpayers, are paying for this project cost. The project started FEBRUARY 2014 with a Contract Completion of 60 days and now its OVER ONE (1) YEAR and still not finish. I hope you will do something NOW about this matter.

More than two months ago, DPWH and their contractor started digging our street. Now it lays ravaged, ruined, destroyed, abused, defiled, degraded, polluted, abandoned. Very little work is being done. The workers (about five of them at any given time) say, they don\'t have materials to work on. Their back hoe/digger came down once. It was only lately that my neighbors started to complain about the gaping manholes that they put those flimsy wooden ""safety"" barricades. 

No signs about the construction going on. We don\'t know the start and finish date. We don\'t know the private contractor. Not even the workers know, they say, sounds like ""flordelis.""

They struck open a Maynilad pipeline. Good the Maynilad responded speedily. But water was all around and has become the breeding place of mosquitoes. Already, there were four cases of dengue here. And the mosquitoes are everywhere 24/7. 

Who can help us? Our baranggay officials, from chairman down seems hopeless/helpless. Or they pretend to be. I understand that there is some goodwill money given to baranggays during construction work like this. I wonder.....hmmmmmmmmm Is that the reason our chairman is so quiet?

The legacy u can leave the DPWH is giving back the confidence of people in the agency. But the efforts we have exerted so far has only lasting effect. the fact that there are officers, middle managers that are very protective of their wards despite the misdemeanor they do is an indication that the straight path we advocate is not yet inculcated in their way of life. Our respectable USEC Medenilla's support of MS MARIA Antoinette PUNO, the OIC chief accountant is so evident, her incompetence notwithstanding. Her errors in judgement have caused the agency enormous troubles in terms of money and delays. We are committed to perform at least 70 percent of the agency target but at the rate We are going, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REACH IT. After the double payments were discovered we are wondering how many double payments are out there remaining to be discovered. Up to now, no recommendation or changes in the system have been installed to safeguard against double payments. All she did was pass the blame on the person who encoded the transaction. Thanks to u sir, the contractor returned the erroneous payment made after 3 months. at least because of your good screening of contractors for the agency, we have legit contractors as clients.

"CFMC-20150453","Dear Secretary Singson,

Nais ko po sanang ipaalam ang problemang halos araw araw naming na e-experience lalo na sa umaga (east rembo, makati) , tungkol sa isang pedestrian na nilulumot dito sa service road ng C5 . Marami na rin po akong nakitang mga muntik ng madulas at isa na po ako duon.

Nag bigay na rin po ako ng sulat sa aming Barangay, sila naman po ay tumugon at kanila po itong nilinis. Ngunit ang source po problema po ay nanatiling naroon.

Kung pwede lang po ay ito ay malinis, i-divert yung tubig na nanggaling sa itaas, lagyan ng maliit na canal ang nilalabasan ng tubig sa ibaba upang hindi kumalat ang tubig sa pedestrian, maiwasan ang lumot at aksidente sa maraming dumadaan lalo na sa umaga.

Naka attach po ang mga pictures.

Marami pong salamat.

God Bless po.","2015-03-26 08:37:53","5",NULL

"CFMC-20150463","Greetings! This is to report stalled road repair located at Longos, Bacoor, Cavite. I noticed that this said repair was already in progress since my arrival from Australia in January 11, 2015 but was not completed since then. For the record, it\xe2\x80\x99s been more than two months now since I saw this \xe2\x80\x9con-going construction\xe2\x80\x9d. Though there is little progress since January, unfortunately and just to emphasize, the remaining unpaved part of the road takes more than two months now and counting. As of this writing, it is not even improving at any pace, as there were no construction workers working on it (day or night) and the truck is apparently stuck only for display. Please note and as we know, this remaining unpaved road has caused massive traffic jams every morning and afternoon/evening especially during rush hours, including even weekends. Again as a matter of fact during morning rush hours, vehicles from Cavite to Manila needs to counter flow and occupy the opposite lane/direction just to lessen the burden of those going to their offices, among other errands. However, this is still not an effective and efficient way to address the situation which also compromises the time/resources of those going to Cavite, and ultimately worsens the traffic condition further. As you are probably aware of, this has adverse effects to people\xe2\x80\x99s productivity, resources such as money and time, among other delays such as delivery of goods etc. Attached are some pictures I personally took supporting my report for your information, reference and appreciation of what is the reality. I hope that concerned agencies take this seriously and with utmost urgency so as not to cause further adverse effects to the people, and the economy as a whole. Your positive response on this matter is highly appreciated. Thank you for the attention and support. Very truly yours, (signed) Sir Angelo Y.

In behalf of my kabarangays, I would just like to voice out our frustration regarding the collapsed portion of the arnedo dike here in san vicente, apalit, pampanga, which gave way on 14 july 2014. The contractor who was tasked to do repairs on the said dike proved to be a negligent one, as he allowed the dike to be eroded. Worse, when the dike collapsed, he and his men were nowhere to be found. As of this writing, the river is still threatening to overflow and submerge our locality's estimated 400 families, as only a few sandbags remain as our defense from the rampaging waters of the mighty pampanga river. What makes matters worse is the inevitability of the coming of the rainy season, as repairs will surely take some material time to be made. In this regard, we are imploring your good office to initiate the necessary repairs of the collapsed portion of the arnedo dike, if only to dissuage the fears of the people of san vicente of an impending catastrophe.

I also want to say I am not looking for any monetary compensation for this accident. That is correct, the areas where the actual project is located, the road signs were strategically placed. That is also correct the accident occurred in the contractor's batching area. That being said, in the contractor's batching area, you can see the gravel on the highway, as seen in the picture from the above attachment, it may not be a very clear picture but you can see it. The Matalom Police also spoke to the contractor about the gravel in the traffic lane. I apologize for not being clear, when I mentioned the warning signs, I was referring to the batching area where the construction vehicles were entering and leaving the highway. I appreciate the DPWH communicating with the contractor about being respectful to the public. This complaint, which cost money in the form of man hours, paperwork and fuel could have been avoided if the contractor simply kept the highway free from debris (gravel) in the batching area and behaved in a respectful manner. Again, I thank you for taking the time to resolve this complaint and God bless.

March 25, 2015

Attn:  Secretary Rogelio Singson
\t
Dear Sir,

I am Criselda delos Reyes, formally file my complaint against your sub-contractor Steven Construction. I really need your help with this.

The accident happened on 2015 of March 07 Saturday between 12:00 NN \xe2\x80\x93 1:30 PM when we were passing along A. Mendoza St. Sta Cruz Manila.  The construction worker carrying a pail (bucket) on his shoulder  suddenly hit the right side mirror of my vehicle when he  came out from the concrete barrier of the construction site that causes my vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s  side mirror broken.  It happened due to the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s negligence and lack of early device warning. 
During my inquiry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that Steven Construction was not prepared and not ready for the safety of their workers and motorists as well. 

I am also stating some of our conversation I recalled during the incident and after the admission of their faults.

When I stopped and asked the worker why he had to come out from the barrier, he replied back by telling me \xe2\x80\x9cnasaktan na nga po ako eh, puede naman kami lumabas anytime na gusto namen\xe2\x80\x9d.
I asked him, bakit ka nasaktan when you are carrying a bucket on your shoulder?? Is it proper doing that in your workplace??  
The work area and the space provided inside were enough for them to walk through (attached picture) and that made me questioned him of his reasons for coming out from the barrier.   
He just walked out and said nothing\xe2\x80\xa6 

I asked from other workers the person in-charged of the project because something came up but no one cares from the superiors; even if we had an accident or any discomfort from the worker involved.  
Then, a person came forward not far from the incident and introduces himself as the Foreman.  
I asked him about the broken side mirror and the person involved, explained to him their responsibility as a contractor because of negligence and lack of safety devices.
He just told me \xe2\x80\x9ckausapin nyo na lang po yung taong nasaktan at pwede naman kami lumabas (from barrier) anytime kasi nagta-trabaho kami dito\xe2\x80\x9d.
I was really surprised because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really know the safety of his people including the by-passers and motorists like us.
I asked him if there\xe2\x80\x99s another person in-charged of the project who can handle the situation and he pointed the Engineer who happened to be a few steps away from us.
The Foreman walked out and said to my brother \xe2\x80\x9cbayaran nyo na lang kasi ng panggamot para dina kayo maabala pa.\xe2\x80\x9d 
The Engineer on site introduces himself as Engineer Ariel.  My brother asked him about the safety devices like the caution tape and he replied back \xe2\x80\x9csa gabi lang po namin nilalagay Sir\xe2\x80\x9d.
We were shocked and asked him again, \xe2\x80\x9cdi ba kayo nagtatrabaho pag araw? Dapat di nyu inaalis and caution tape, dapat ayusin nyo workplace ng site.\xe2\x80\x9d
Followed up by asking him, \xe2\x80\x9cbakit kulang ang mga safety devices nyo and even the workers walang alam sa safety?\xe2\x80\x9d
He just said  \xe2\x80\x9cdi naman po ako nagkulang ng paalala sa tao ko\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d and to stop us maybe from  questioning,  he continued by saying \xe2\x80\x9cnakausap ko na po yun boss ko, sasagutin daw po ang damages at ayusin na lang po natin para matapos na\xe2\x80\x9d
I asked him the name of their company but he refused to give the address, email add and the contact numbers. He said, its in  Ortigas and far from Manila but everyday naman daw sya nasa site and gave me his CP number 0947 601 1907 instead, and promised to pay for the damages because he acknowledges their fault then we left from the site believing that we have a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s agreement.

So we went directly to Ford Alabang after my appointment in Manila to get the quotation (attached) for the side mirror as I have thought, it will be fixed the same day.  
The service advisor told us, that it will be replaced after 3 weeks provided we will pay in advance to ship the item.
I made a phone call to Engr. Ariel to 0947 601 1907  using my husband\xe2\x80\x99s CP#0917 824 5869 and he agreed to pay but according to him, he will wait for his boss who has also busy with their project in Bicol and will be here in Manila the following week. 
I told him, the time is important to us because my vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s side mirror was broken and needed a replacement the soonest but we have to pay in advance to place the order.
I told him that this is not what we have agreed while we were in Manila and he started to discuss with me the driver\xe2\x80\x99s liability and I replied back to him that it would be better if he will talk to my counsel instead of putting all the blame in me.  He told me, may abogado din daw ang kumpanya nila at may pananagutan ako kaya ukey lang daw naman then I told him bakit pa sya nakikipag-ayos sakin if sila ang victim at ako person na may pananagutan. 
He told me, hindi nya ako bine-blame but nag-explain lang sya sa driver\xe2\x80\x99s liability dahil nasaktan ang tao nya at nakikipag-ayos na sya dahil may fault din daw sila. Hindi ko man lang daw dinala ang tao nya sa hospital para ipagamot because masakit daw ang shoulder.
I told him, it was his responsibility because he is the superior and should look after the safety of his people. 
He told me, he asked the worker to be checked in the hospital but refused to come.
If the worker was badly hurt, he cannot standstill and work after the incident.  
During the incident, my 15 year old son approached the worker if he is okey but he just left and ignore my son\xe2\x80\x99s concerned.
Another fact, if he\xe2\x80\x99s responsible enough he may come hurriedly during the time when the accident is happening and not to display his concerned after accepting their faults.
If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come\xe2\x80\xa6. is that how a responsible superior should be acting??

Our phone conversation that day, ended in the agreement of sending them the amount to be paid to inform his boss.
I sent him a text message with the amount after the phone conversation using my cp number 0916 323 7224 of March 07 2015.
On Monday of March 09 2015,  I was on my way to the nearest police station of where the incident happened I made another call to Engr. Ariel using my cp number 0916 323 7224.
I also texted him at around 9:30 am and attached with this also my text conversation with him.
He did not reply so I went to the station to blotter as per my friend\xe2\x80\x99s advice because it should be done as I am not aware that it has to be filed earlier and I am not familiar to the place.
I asked the police to help me and visited the site because the Engineer on site started to threaten me.
The conversation didn\xe2\x80\x99t go well when I made a phone call at around 12:30nn \xe2\x80\x93 1:30pm if I remember correctly because it was after my class along Recto.
I asked him, why I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything from them and they don\xe2\x80\x99t care the urgency of the situation.
He told me, \xe2\x80\x9cMonday pa lang po at nasa meeting po ako kaya di ako makareply. Wala pa po yun boss, i-update ko po kayo at sigurado po na mag-uusap kayo within this week kasi busy pa po sa Bicol. \xe2\x80\x9c
I told him, how long I will wait when I had my number with him and should he be the one to call me if he cannot decide on the matter??
How can I put my mind at ease when he\xe2\x80\x99s always waiting for his boss to come in Manila and he just keeps delaying the situation and he refused giving the Company\xe2\x80\x99s information?
Then, he told me\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9dma\xe2\x80\x99am busy lang po talaga at baka nakakalimutan nyo po na may pananagutan din kayo sa tao namin bilang driver, puede ko nga po kayong ipa-blotter. Di nyu nga po dinala sa ospital yun tao\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6
He brought back the topic regarding the hospital issue confidently but he never realized how negligent and irresponsible he was.
I told him, he\xe2\x80\x99s free to report the incident and he\xe2\x80\x99s now threatening me so we will know who violated the rules and as I have mentioned it would be better if our counsels will do the talking since we are both trying to prove innocence of both parties but he ended the conversation that he will send me the updates on how they will settle the broken side mirror.
 
They did not coordinate with me since March 09 of 2015.  The police visited the site to investigate but the Foreman said to the officer that we are in the process of coordinating the issue and after the police left the site, the Engineer send me a text as attached dated March 09 2015 but that was the last information I got from them.
I asked the police officer for the report and picked up the following day March 10, 2015 and forwarded to the Insurance Company supposedly the contractors responsibility.

I am attaching pictures and other documents that you might need for investigation.
I want to teach them a lesson for their negligence and lack of safety devices that will harm the workers, by-passers, and motorists as well. 

Hope to hear from you.

Thank you,

"CFMC-20150506","Dear Ma’am, 

I have problem in my payroll account that was discovered lately.

March 29, 2015, I used to withdraw my payroll account #0287202628 at LBP-QC Circle. It has a total balance of PHP 4,636.28 and only an available balance of PHP 1,573.08. I was expecting to withdraw PH 13,500.

March 30, 2015, I proceed in LBP South Harbor and found that the said payroll account has debits through “online transaction” with the following data. (see attached letter)
According to LBP officer, in order to make an on-line transaction, the details on front of the ATM card number and the three-digit printed at the back of the card is the only requirement for anyone to transact on-line.

I requested to immediately hold all withdrawal transaction of the account. I was instructed to accomplish a LBP form that complains an authorized on-line purchase and prepare a letter of complaint addressed to LBP General Manager.

March 31, 2015, I submitted a letter of complaint to Gen. Manager LBP – South Harbor Branch. I also filled up a new form of complaint addressed for the LBP head office.

In the afternoon, I went to HRD and I learned that my personal data sheet and a back to back Xerox copy of my ATM card is attached along with necessary records for processing my first take home pay. Those documents were received by HRD last Feb 3, 2015, the first time the account was debited through on-line transaction.

Somewhere in processing of payroll, or divulging/printing all data on ATM card, or the steps in processing and validating online transactions, has made my payroll account hacked. Outcome of procedures/requirements in the payroll system is not beyond my control which I feel I should be protected.

This problem could happen to other new employees too.

I am hoping for your help to expedite immediate recovery of those debited amount.

Respectfully Yours,

"CFMC-20150511","Dear Mr. Secretary,

Good day,

This is to respectfully refer on the above subject to call your immediate action regarding the same.

Being a taxpayer, commuter and Cavitex resident would like to demand an explanation from your good self why the above subject had been given a permit despite the following reasons;

-Re-blocking of the above subject was done not less than 2 years ago;
-Contractor has few men (less than 5) working from 8AM - 5PM, with no visible worker during Sundays is Philippine Government allow shall pace construction activities along major road, more especially in Highways?;
- No contractor's name, date start and duration of the project, and how much taxpayers' money were squeazed from, conspicuously displayed in the immediate surroundings of the project;
-It uses huge equipment that occupies almost half of the road, thereby preventing the usual traffic flow, most especially every rush hours.
- No alternate route offered to ease the agony of the people being affected.

Or, just to stir your curiosity, is it willfully done so that all motorist will use the CAVITEX so as for its operator take revenues? in there local politics involve?

We, the common-people is always the victims what the politician or power-wielding servant (KUNO).

Again, as a taxpayer, legal and law abiding citizen of this country, I demand an immediate action.

Mr. Win Jose

I would like to raise again my concern regarding the Contractor Northern Builders (NB) for the Project: Concreting of Payatas Road (formerly Litex Road) the concreting of said portion of road was already done but the manholes were left opened. They just placed on the perimeter of the manhole some concrete barrier (with name as NB). The part of concrete road was done but why is it that they left the manholes uncovered for a long time until now. The uncovered manhole is not safe to all types of vehicles and I noticed that since the manholes are left open the opening are now full of concrete debris and garbage which makes the drainage clogged when rainy season come. This Contractor is very irresponsible from the start up to this time. Hope you make necessary inspection and action on this part before you issue the final payment of Northern Builders because the budget for this gov't project comes from the Filipino taxes.

"CFMC-20150540","Good day Sir/Ma\'am,
I wish to report on what I consider as unsafe signages and lacking of proper safety signs regarding the road repair along the Dologon-Tubigon highway, between Edlimar Spring Resort and RR Family Spring Resort to wit:
1. The signs, placed about 50-100 meters before the site of road repair, are not reflectorized, made only of tarpaulin material. They are not right away visible especially at night.
2. The signs which are placed about 50-100 meters before the site of road repair says: ""Sorry for the inconvenience, road repair ahead"". Should it be more proper to have signs such as, ""WARNING or CAUTION: Reduce speed or slow down, road repair ahead. Sorry for the inconvenience"" which are placed at regular intervals meters ahead of the actual road repair sight?
3. The area is downhill/uphill, depending on where you are coming from. If you happen to come from Maramag and is going to Valencia, the safety signs are very useful and should be very visible and reflectorized/luminous especially at night. 
Hope these would be of help especially that we want to prevent accidents and injuries while allowing a smooth conduct road repair works.

"CFMC-20150584","The former DPH employee advised us that the national highway going north in Ilocos Norte is being widened.  I can understand the need of course due to increased tourism in that region.  But we have not received any notification in writing on this matter.  In looking at your website, I don't see any current proposals affecting the road traversing Pasuquin to Pagudpud. And if so, I would think that the plans would then affect not just the road but also bridges.

When we purchased the land, the fence was already there ( a non-permanent structure) so we decided to build a concrete fence. That's when this woman approached my husband and threatened to knock it down unless we cooperated with her. I am not sure what that cooperation meant because the fence then was left alone.

Now, this woman is returning telling us to make sure we let her know so she can go and speak with people she knows at the Department.  Having poured so much money already into that fence built in 2002, I don't understand why it would now be the subject of this woman since I do know there is such a thing called law of eminent domain but that the citizenry would be entitled to a written notice.

She quit her job at the Department where we learned later she was a casual employee but still gives us the impression that she has connections. I certainly don't want to be engaged in any form of bribing employees if that is what she is insinuating. Rather, we would like to have the ability to explain our situation and follow your guidelines within the law.

I have spoken to two acquaintances who are lawyers in Ilocos. They all believe that the department would give us a written notice for any road widening or construction that would affect private property.  I feel your department would do the same.  Since I don't see it as part of your website's projects, I am confident we are not going to be affected.

"CFMC-20150585","This pertains to the published article in the Manila Times on Saturday, April 18, 2015 at p. A4, entitled ""Insanity and never-ending corruption in DPWH"" authored by Mr. Rick Ramos, Executive Director of InfraWatch, to wit: 

There appears to be No End to the unbridled corruption at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), a favorite government agency of President Benigno S. Aquino 3rd whose leadership he greatly admires.

Last Tuesday, April 7, President Aquino inaugurated a bridge in Isabela and once again commended the DPWH ""leadership of Secretary Rogelio Singson."" As usual, P-Noy once again took the golden opportunity of blaming the past administration of their failure to build the bridge that was damaged in 1993.

Of course, what the pathetic President B. S. Aquino 3rd will never tell and admit to the Filipino people and the world is that the past three presidents before him - Fidel V. Ramos (FVR), Joseph Estrada (ERAP), and Gloria M. Arroyo (GMA) - started and built more public infrastructure than him. In a short span of 2.5 years of the Estrada presidency, ERAP initiated the 88-km Subic-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) that was completed during GMA's time.

The P773 Million Lullutan Bridge is another 'concrete proff"" (to use his own words) of the Never-Ending corruption in the DPWH under the Daang Matuwid Aquino administration. With a length of 500 linear meters, it should have cost P250 million at P500,000 per linear meter (LM). Hence, an Obscene Overprice of P500 Million!!!

The price of P500,000 per LM is the cost of high-quality bridges in the private sector. This is what it will cost property developers like Ayala Land, SM Prime Holdings, DMCI and others in their projects. In fact, P500,000 was the cost of the Elevated Skyway along South Luzon Expressway (SLEX).

The 420-meter Mambaling fly-over in Cebu City only cost P110 million when it was built by DPWH in April of 2011. Thus, the cost of P262,000 per LM!!!Even if you double the figure due to inflation and increase in DPWH corruption, it should be P500,000 per LM. But the P773-million 500-meter Lullutan Bridge in Isabela inaugurated by P-Noy cost THREE TIMES-P1,546,000 per LM.

Yet President B. S. Aquino 3rd has the brazen temerity - or just sheer stupidity - to cite the ""5Rs"" of the DPWH ""under the leadership of Secretary Rogelio Singson"" - the ""Right Project, Right Quality, Right People, Right Time and the Right Cost."" For starters, we can be sure the Lullutan Bridge was NOT BUILT at the Right Cost!!!

To give you an idea of the shameless and obscene overprice, the 1.23 km four-lane tunnel in Cebu City built during the last year of the President GMA cost P1,341,000 per LM. Even factor in inflation of 20 percent over the past 4.5 years and it will cost you only P1.6M per linear meter. The two-lane Lullutan Bridge cost P1.546M per LM. Remember that the Cebu Tunnelhas FOUR LANES!!!

SHAMELESS CORRUPTION IN MANILA AND BAGUIO

The REBLOCKING by DPWH along EDSA and C-5 during the Holy Week caused humongous traffic. The worst part is that there was NO NEED to destroy the concrete pavement along EDSA and C-5 since they were still in good condition. If there were any minor cracks, they could easily be repaired. Worst part is that DPWH will spend another P3.7 billion along EDSA for the asphalt overlay.

Based on the monitoring of the Citizens Infrastructure Integrity Watchdog (InfraWatch) for the past five years (201-2015), Baguio City holds the dubious distinction of being one of the most corrupt as far as DPWH projects are concerned. Among the regional centers, Baguio comes close to Iloilo City, which is the ""Corruption Capital of PH"" when it comes to public infrastructure that involves the DPWH, DoTC and the LGU.

Baguio is the regional center of the Cordillera Autonomous Region (CAR), while Iloilo is the regional center of Western Visayas (Region VI).


(DISCLOSURE: THIS WRITER IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INFRAWATCH)

What has become the brand or ""trademark"" of the DPWH Daang Matuwid is it's nefarious ""REBLOCKING"" projects where good concreted pavements are destroyed only to be concreted again. During the holidays last Holy Week, DPWH did its despicable ""REBLOCKING"" on roads perpendicular to Session Road (near the Cathedral) and Leonard Wood Road (beside Cabinet Hill). What is worse here, as what the DPWH contractors did in EDSA and C-5, is that the sections of the roads ""REBLOCKED"" are not even cut/sliced (longitudinal) first so as not to damage the contiguous sections or lanes.

The brazen temerity of the DPWH-CAR is further demonstrated by the flagrant ""REBLOCKING"" of the Sto. Tomas Road leading to Green Valley and to the top of the mountains where the radar stations are located. The 200-meter section that has been demolished and is being concreted located is in front of the Dairy Farm of the Department of Agriculture. The Sto. Tomas Road, which starts at the Marcos Highway is well-paved with asphalt overlay.

The District Engineering Office in Baguio has also undertaken road-widening that serves no purpose to add capacity because they are narrow at 1.5-2.0 meters wide and are not contiguous. They will just become parking areas along the national highway, such as in Kennon Road and along Ferguson Road fronting the huge property of the Department of Agriculture (DA) for the CAR. This type of road widening projects by the DPWH has been done in other areas in Luzon, such as Sta. Rosa-Tagaytay Road in Laguna near SLEX.

Speaking of the 30-km. Kennon Road that begins at Camp I in Tuba, Benguet and runs to Baguio City, it is amazing that it is not a smooth well-paved national road in spite of the hundreds of millions of pesos spent by the Daang Matuwid 
Aquino administration. Instead of doing simple and fast asphalt overlay on the pavement, Secretary Singson would prefer the more expensive and unnecessary ""REBLOCKING"" that leads to bigger project costs that benefit both the contractors and officials of DPWH.

Residents of Baguio and environs (Tuba, Sto. Tomas, La Trinidad and Sabang), as well as visitors to the country's smmer capital can only shake their heads and wonder why DPWH indulges in such acts of insanity. But then, corruption in the favorite government agency of P-Noy has become so inordinate (excessive) that lunacy may be an understatement.

'CONGRATULATIONS' TO DPWH ON ITS 'ACHIEVEMENTS'

After almost five years of the Aquino administration, perhaps it is time to ""congratulate"" DPWH for its outstanding ""achievements"" that will become its legacy to the Filipino people. Other than its notorious ""REBLOCKING,"" DPWH has implemented asphalt-overlay that is not even needed on national highways, such as Sucat Road (A. Santos Ave.) in Paranaque and the Sta. Rosa-Tagaytay Road in Laguna.

Worse, DPWH applied double asphalt overlay 5 cms (4 inches) thick so that pavements are now as high or higher than the sidewalks. Worst, DPWH created a problem for vehicles crossing these raised/elevated national roads.","2015-04-20 13:43:38","4",NULL

Dear Sir:

I am an employee of this department and I am also a concerned citizen wherein a very traumatic experienced had happen to us during our return back to Manila from the Province in Lamut, Ifugao.

Last April 12, 2015 at around 2:00 AM we were halted near a police station before the city proper of San Jose City because of the ongoing road construction on that area. The traffic situation on the area was observed to be heavy and that kilometres of motorist were already piling-up until such a traffic aide advice light vehicular motorist to divert to a local road wherein telling us that it\xe2\x80\x99s a short cut to reach San Jose City. Traversing more or less 700M  there was a temporary signage made of plywood an arrow left and markings of  \xe2\x80\x9cTO SAN JOSE CITY\xe2\x80\x9d. Traversing again around 300m more or less an arrow left sign again, until we reach a certain rough road and there was a traffic aide letting us cross a \xe2\x80\x9cbox culvert\xe2\x80\x9d in an irrigation canal then a concrete road, after around 200m there was a junction, an unnoticeable gravel road and the continuity of the concrete road. The motorist ahead of us followed the concrete road and we also followed. Traversing a combination of concrete and gravel road until we observed that we are already climbing a newly graded gravel road. I am already apprehensive because the terrain becomes winding and   seeing lights downhill believed to be San Jose City proper. Back of my mind reasons, that we were on the right track because of the effort that it was recently graded for the convenience of the motorist rerouting.  Until we are halted because motorist ahead of us stop. Thought it was due to traffic again. But I was already alighted because why we are in the middle of nowhere and in a roadway on a mountain side. We already wonder why it took so long that the motorist ahead us moves, until we received relayed messages of drivers ahead of us that no more road to traverse, that it was a dead end.

This time, I panicked, I was nervous, cold feel creep on my nerves, I rattled because of the thought that we were lost in the middle of nowhere and that it is almost 4:00 AM. What about if there were nice people around that might notice we were lost and that the thought of bad things might happened. Until we decided to turn around.  

If only there were enough traffic signages and traffic aide in every junction of the road to guide motorist especially it was dark not even street lights to guide us. It was a horrible and traumatic experienced and even me an employee of DPWH had to undergo these very traumatic experienced because of insufficient and lowly traffic management. I know even those who experienced the same fate that we have might curse the people who were responsible of what they have undergone/suffered.

I hope this could be an eye opener that traffic management is very important in a road construction notwithstanding that there is a pay item on this on the Program of Works.

"CFMC-20150596","I wish to report on what I consider as unsafe signages and lacking of proper safety signs regarding the road repair along the Dologon-Tubigon highway, between Edlimar Spring Resort and RR Family Spring Resort to wit:
1. The signs, placed about 50-100 meters before the site of road repair, are not reflectorized, made only of tarpaulin material. They are not right away visible especially at night.
2. The signs which are placed about 50-100 meters before the site of road repair says: ""Sorry for the inconvenience, road repair ahead"". Should it be more proper to have signs such as, ""WARNING or CAUTION: Reduce speed or slow down, road repair ahead. Sorry for the inconvenience"" which are placed at regular intervals meters ahead of the actual road repair sight?
3. The area is downhill/uphill, depending on where you are coming from. If you happen to come from Maramag and is going to Valencia, the safety signs are very useful and should be very visible and reflectorized/luminous especially at night. 
Hope these would be of help especially that we want to prevent accidents and injuries while allowing a smooth conduct road repair works.

We would like to inquire on the DPWH Bukidnon project implementation on the road repair along the section of Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon Road(Manolo Fortich Municipal Hall to Colex Gas Station section).

Most of us notice that are seemingly no significant road damage a few months ago but the road section portions are being worked on. Holes were bored to the road which was seemingly layered with asphalt. Being road users and concerned citizens, we would like to inquire and be shed light on the process of determining if the road section already need repair. This is also on the background that we have seen a number of road sections in Bukidnon that really needs repair yet repairs are not yet scheduled for this. 

Thank you for your assistance. More power and God bless!

sUBJECT: CP4 April 12 and April 13, 2015 Category 3 Incidences

Dear Mr. Hara:

Please see my comments below with regards the incident reports and related pictures on the April 12 & 13, 2015 incidences that occurred in CP4:

1. Incident Report 149;
I could understand that there may have been difficulty in getting information on the drivers' licenses but why were there no plate numbers and a description of the vehicle damage?
The ""initial root cause analysis"" mentioned ""driver's error"". I believe that the preparer of the report should have been more specific on this. What was the error of the driver? Who was the driver who committed the error?

The ""recommendation/comments/actions taken"" mentioned ""always drive in condition"". What does this mean?

The incident report did not mention anything about the lack of or existence of road safety measures along the site of the incident. I think that this is an important part of the report. This information will guide on what to do in order to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. Is the road section provided with adequate signages and road markings and road markings? Is the curved section already provided with chevron signs?

2. Incident Report 150:
In the information box for “ Plate Number”, it is written “motorcycle not identified”. Was there no plate number on the motorcycle?
In the information box for “ Vehicle Damage”, it is written “Internal and External Damage”. What does this mean?
Similar to the Incident Report 149, I believe that the “initial root cause analysis” is inadequate
The recommendation/comments/action taken” also mentioned “always drive in condition”. What does this mean? The incident report should mention something about the lack of or existence of road safety measures along the site of the incident, not just stating that there was no obstruction.
3. The pictures attached to Incident Report 149 showed a number of disturbing and/or gruesome images of the victims. Please be careful in disseminating these pictures. We may be being disrespectful of the privacy of the victims or we may be offending the sensibilities of some of the readers to whom you send the repot. I suggest that you do not send the gruesome images with the report but just say that you have pictures related to the report that may be disturbing to the reader and if the reader would want to see the pictures you can send them through another email or  communication with the condition that the pictures be treated with confidentiality.
Your prompt response to this letter is most appreciated.
Thank you.

November 3, 2014


ROGELIO L. SINGSON
Secretary
Dept. of Public Works and Highways
Manila

Sir:

May the undersigned individuals, all Filipinos, have the honor to inform your good office about the newly finished project, the open concrete canal along the National Highway by the Uy Construction and Development, of the DPWH in our area (Purok 5) which is ineffective for it has not solved our problem during heavy rains. Our complaints about it are the following:

1. The canal receives water but the water is stagnant for how many days before it is drained but not completely;
2. The canal receives water not from the households but from the highway alone that is why we need some boat when we want to go to the highway for the water around our houses levels up; and,
3. Portions of the project are closed by the DPWH workers with soil and we don't know if it has ""imburnal"" or culvert beneath it which we think the reason why the water is not flowing moderately during heavy rains.

Sir, we believe projects of your office aim to help the majority but we need to inform you about how your project works.

We are hoping of your immediate and positive response regarding this information. Thank you very much! God bless you.

Very truly yours,

"CFMC-20150648","To: MR. Rogelio L Singson Sir, It was in the year 2011 when the good secretary with much pride told the DPWH employees that He is giving twenty thousand pesos to the BEST performing office, Ten Thousand pesos to those who performed BETTER, 5 Thousand to those whose performance are considered GOOD and none to those who did not make it to the grades. GOOD - BETTER \xe2\x80\x93 BEST. Parang PUSOY. The C N A incentive Bonus during that time was agreed upon by the union and management at 20k. The employees then would want the reward be given to them across the board since what we do here in this agency is a team effort and the grading of offices is too subjective that only those who are close to the powers that be might receive the awards. And so it went. Comes now the disallowance made by the COA, who usually has been a recipient of C N A incentive bonus before the term of Secretary Singson except in 2011 onwards. The disallowance was based on a DBM Circular providing a ceiling of 25k to C N A incentive bonus of employees which was made known to all agencies in September, 2011. This DBM rule is like changing rules in the middle of the game. The C N A incentive Bonus before September 2011 shall be based on the savings and the general provisions stating the priority in the use of savings of the GAA for the particular year. Suddenly the DBM ceiling. PUSOY TALAGA. Me panggugulang pa kasama! The irony of it all, the good secretary also requested that the usual 10k we receive from the office of the president every Christmas be slashed to 5 thousand so we can help the victims of calamities during that year. As far as I can remember it was the Typhoon Pablo that brought destruction to the people of the Southern Philippines. But the slashed Christmas Bonus became permanent. And now since 2011, we have a Christmas bonus reduced by half permanently. Then this secretary was claiming that he is very generous to the employees of the DPWH... Double jeoparfy. Our xmas bonus was reduced by 5k per year. And already 4 years hence. We were robbed of the Christmas bonus and still you want us to refund! Have the honourable Rogelio L. Singson any notion of the Net Take home pay of the DPWH employees? Did the secretary realize that most of the employees here are receiving less than six thousand pesos a month after deducting GSIS, Taxes and Loans from various financial institutions?'","2015-05-04 14:05:20","1","5"

I would like to ask if it is right that the DPWH is completely destroying an asphalted concrete road about 5 kilometers long samantalang may malaki pang bahagi Ng kalsada na Hindi concreto at sira sira na kailangang kailangan sanang sementohin dahil subrang perwesyo ito tuwing tag-Ulan. Ito po ay nangyayari sa Argao-Ronda axis road sa probinsya ng Cebu. Para sa akin ito po ay isang kalokohan dahil sinisira ang mga bagay na mapapakinabangan pa samantalang may mga bahagi na  tinitiis nalang. This is another form of legal corruption. Dahil paulit ulit na senesemento ang isang bahagi  ng kalsada. Halos pang apat na beses na yata inu-ulit nila ang ganoong gawain.

According to him, there's no warning devices and the barriers are not in the right places.

They were immediately rushed to Pasay General Hospital for medical attention. It caused them inconvenience especially to his wife because she was not able to go to work.

""Mga pasa at gasgas yung inabot namin. Yung wife ko hindi nga nakapasok today."" he added.

They are willing to settle this by not yet filing any charges against the contractor. As much as possible, they want the coordination from DPWH and the contractor regarding his concern. He has documents for reference.

Please refer his complaint to the right department for corrective action. Thanks and regards... Gilbert From: Mike Jose <donpmj@yahoo.com>; To: jose gilbert <gilbertjose@yahoo.com>; Cc: Jose Carlo <cmfjose@gmail.com>; Subject: Contractor made flooding Sent: Sat, May 30, 2015 1:50:20 PM Dear Sec Singson, I am writing your good office to complain about the carelessness and insensitivity of a contractor doing drainage improvement work on Gen Luna near the corner of Padre Faura Ermita manila. There was a thunderstorm on May 30, 2015 in our area at around 9pm lasting for more than 30 minutes. This caused flooding in front of our house and even caused water to enter our garage which has never happened in the last 38 years of our stay in the area. The contractor FLORDES CONSTRUCTION AND TRADIMG CORP excavated Gen Luna St dumping all the soil at the side of the road covering all the storm drains and gutters thus preventing the free flow of water. The soil created a dam in front of our house thus this problem of flooding and water entering our garage. It seems they failed to notice Gen Luna's elevation is higher from the corner of UN Avenue and rain water goes down towards Padre Faura and on to Taft Avenue. Also the street level is already higher than our sidewalk therefore the tendency of water to go to side of the road where the gutters and sidewalks are. We have never had water logged like this in front of our house in the 38 years that My wife and have lived here. Not even Ondoy did this to us. It's only during the night of May 30, 2015 that this occurred due to the carelessness of the contractor Involved. In fact water had entered our garage and as of 930pm last night it was 5inches away from having water coming into our home on the ground floor level. Good thing the rains stopped preventing water from entering our ground floor level. Sad to say I talked to the foreman of the contractor in the morning of May 30th and told him about our concern and the possibility of this happening but I was told that the excess soil will be hauled away during the day. Well apparently they did not do so. my wife and I had to clean out the sidewalk and the inside of our garage of mud and water in the morning of May 31st. Two senior citizens having to do this all because someone did not pay attention and failed to consider the implications of their actions. We would appreciate if the proper department could be informed of this situation and if the contractor can be given instructions to correct the situation immediately and for them to avoid dumping soil in front of our house to prevent another occurrence of this problem. As long as the excess soil from the excavation remains there, the threat of flood water entering our garage and home will be there. Please inform FLORDES CONSTRCTUON that we are senior citizens in the household and at the same time I am also a PWD and this situation is stressing us out for as long as the gutters and storm drains are clogged up with soil. The soil MUST BE REMOVED AND THE STORM DRAINS AND GUTTERS CLEANED UP IMMEDIATELY to prevent another flooding of our garage and possibly our home. Thank you for your kind attention. Mike Jose \t

"CFMC-20150825","A good friend friend of mine Joji Baggao- Borromeo from Ilagan City in Isabela posted these pictures of terrible traffic in the mountain highways in Nueva Vizcaya which we from Isabela and Cagayan provinces have to travel and cross every time we visit our hometowns. Every year we experience such terrible traffics due to the constant road repairs done by the DPWH and their contractors - surprisingly every year. They have this crazy practice of boring holes on stretches of roads that are supposed to be repaired even as these are still passable. Presumably they do this to immediately collect the mobilization funds even as their construction timetables would take months and even years. Then they start repairing one side of the road there by creating long stretches of one way traffic in mountain highways of bends and curves causing terrible road congestion and unbearable traffic jams that could take even a whole day. This insensitive approach by DPWH and their contractors must change. Regular travelers and motorists and I hope the businessmen as well, from Cagayan Valley should now unite and take a stand from this abuse and lack of concern about the comforts of the commuter. This also takes its toll on the speed of transporting the produce from the Cagayan Valey region which eventually would affect prices of commodities as the transport cost shall be inputted to the final cost of the product when it reaches the market. Moreover it tremendously affects the quality and final price of perishable products like meat and vegetable. KAWAWA NAMAN ANG MGA TAGA CAGAYAN VALLEY. The DPWH need a change of not only its contractors but in strategy! 
Perhaps its time to build a new highway in the Eastern Seaboard of Luzon from Aurora Province to reach Cagayan Valley! This will not only improve traffic flow and transport speed but will also open up huge economic opportunities in the east coast of Isabela and Cagayan provinces. Yung design ng Highway ay dapat cut and fill para straight line siya, in order to make distance and time travel shorter! As much as possible dapat six lanes para walang closed traffic during repairs and reblocking! Our politicians and highway Engineers should visit and learn from Vietnam and Thailand. Those study tours that politicians and government officials often do (for Tourism) should include site visits on infrastructure developments to to see the new highways in other countries They should go and see the Highways from Bangkok to Chiang Mai in Thailand or the highway from Hanoi to Lao Cai and Sapa in Vietnam.

have been an avid fan of the changes that you have made in the department.

One thing that I admire most is the public's accessibility and interaction with the Department no matter how huge or small the problems is, you always see to it that all are attended accordingly, so hats off for that.

Here is the punchline, I would appreciate it so much if somebody or someone or anyone in the Department that can enlighten me in the process of promotion after the rationalization plan.

Is it still the Departments policy that when it comes to a promotion its not how you know your job but its who you know in the higher ranks.  Before I decided to put these thoughts into writing I repeatedly ask myself if it will benefit me, and my answer is no, because I am one of the casualties of war so to speak. Nevertheless, it will help clear things, recently the Department promoted an Engineer IV named Ma. Victoria Gregorio, mains office BAC office who has been separated in the service way before the rat plan, she has been working overseas for 3 or 4 years there, then after she decided to go home for good she returned in the service right after the chaos of the rat plan emerging as Project Manager.  Well, as long as I remember she did not avail of anything in the rat plan nor resigned nor file a LOA (clearly its not allowed to be on leave for that long in the government) unless she has an exemption to any other ordinary government employee.  Clearly her case is not because of loyalty with the department because there are dozens of Engineers in her rank that's been sticking their  with brains to their jobs in the dept hoping for a similar place where she is.  Anyway can anybody with authority that can explain how this happens? for the sake of what the Departments advocacy (marangal na serbisyo, tungo sa pagbabago)

More power and more answers pls. (peace!)""","2015-06-04 11:04:16","1","3"

ROGELIO SINGSON
DPWH Secretary


SIR:

     This is to disclose to you projects undertaken by the Department of Public Works and Highways along Timog Avenue from Panay Avenue to Scout Tuazon Street, Quezon City wherein a newly asphalted road were excavated and new cement pipes were installed on the roadway. Few years back, similar pipes were installed by MMDA but it is located along the sidewalk. There were so many manholes constructed barely five meters apart. If this is to correct frequent flooding, only a simple upgrading is needed and cleaning of existing cement pipe will already solve the problem. Clearly, a simple practical engineering hence, why waste millions of pesos for this useless project? Likewise, diggings cause millions of pesos in losses to nearby commercial establishments as restoration works were nowhere in sight.

     Similar projects along Tomas Morato were constructed in this manner and yet when rain comes it is still flooded. This only goes to show that a lot of PEOPLE's money is wasted Mr. Secretary!!!

     Looking forward for your immediate investigation on this matter.


                                                   Sincerely yours,

Singson: Greetings to our good Secretary of DPWH we ever had in recent decades ! This has reference to the recently completed road widening of Sgt. Esguerra St. in South Triangle,(passing ABS-CBN station area and my condo residence), in Diliman, Quezon City, with some deficiencies and lacking road standards: a)drainage outlets lacking screen/strainer to prevent garbage entering canals, which will be filled-up with debris later since these are not regularly opened and cleaned (also in many drainage canals in metro manila due to their designs. DPWH should consider Malaysian-designed drainage of open rectangular canals covered with folding steel bars for easy cleaning and spotting of water flows/blocking (rather than the current covered culverts). b)road sidewalks for pedestrians are absent in front of certain business establishments (or slanted sidewalk not suited to sidewalk passers but for car parking \xe2\x80\x93 not consistent to universal standards as seen abroad); and not continuous due to failure to remove the sidewalk-roadblock (presence of carenderia) near the Megaworld condo building.

Singson Kagawaran ng mga Pagawain at Lansangang Pambayan Port Area, Manila Mahal naming Kalihim Singson, Paki imbestigahan naman po ang harapang pagbabalewala at pagmamanipula ng mga taong nakapaligid sa inyo at sa inyong pagnanais na pagbabago sa DPWH. Marahil ay di nyo alam ang background ng taong ito na binigyan nyo ng Special Order para gawing OIC-ADE ng Pampanga 2nd Engineering District (S.O No. 75, S, 2015). Kaya heto po ang kamangha manghang tungkol sa kanya. 1. Siya po si NOMER ABEL P. CANLAS, dating radio operator ng Pampanga Sub-district Engineering Office noong District Engineer pa si USEC Rafael Yabut. Naging Administrative Officer ng Pampanga 1st District Engineering Office kapalit noon ni Ador Canlas na noo\xe2\x80\x99y naging Assistant District Engineer sa Tarlac. 2. Napaka giliw niyang empleyado lalo na sa mga Contractors noong nasa Pampanga 1st District Engineering Office pa siya dahil siya ang nagaayos sa mga ito tuwing may bidding at nangongolekta ng SOP. 3. Nag-aral ng Civil Engineering at nag graduate noong 2013 habang siya ang Administrative Officer ng Pampanga 1st District Office ng hindi man lang nag file ng leave of absence kahit minsan. Ito ay sa panahon ni yumaong D.E. Jose Datu at sinundan ni D.E. Enrico Guilas. Sana ay imbestigahan naman ng Civil Service Commission ang Leave Card nitong taong ito. 4. Kumuha ng C.E. board examination pagka graduate ng hindi man lang nagreview pero pumasa. Dahil sa pagbabayad ng P150,000.00. Kaya po isa siya sa mga produkto ng \xe2\x80\x9cR.A. 150\xe2\x80\x9d kung tawagin namin dito sa Pampanga dahil hindi naman sila karapatdapat na gawaran ng R.A 1080. 5. Nag test sa Promotional Exam noong 2014 pero marahil dahil di puedeng bayaran ang CSC ay hindi pumasa. Subalit na promote parin bilang Engr. IV sa UPMO, mula sa pagiging administrative officer, sa tulong syempre ni USEC at ni Kuyang USEC, ito ay loob ng wala pang isang (1) taon mula ng siya ay nag graduate sa Republic Central Colleges. Mukhang naisahan na naman po ang inyong patakaran. Ang gagaling po nila diba? 6. Matagal na po naming naririnig dito sa Region III ang plano nila USEC at Kuyang Usec na gagawin siyang District Engineer Kapalit ni OIC-DE Juanito Reguyal na magreretiro sa Agusto, at heto na nga po ang kanilang unang hakbang, napa pirma nila ang isang Special Order na ginagawa siyang OIC-ADE. Puede po ba iyon kahit di nya naipasa ang promotional exam?. Hindi po ba pagmamanipula na naman iyon sa mga polisiya ninyo tungo sa pagbabagong anyo ng DPWH? Paki aksyunan naman po agad ito at baka gawan nila ng paraan na gawin siyang Regional Director. Magiging kaawa-awa na naman ang DPWH pag nagkataon dahil halata naman na wala siyang kaalaman sa Civil Engineering profession dahil puro pagkakaperahan lamang ang laman ng kanyang isip. Kayo lamang po ang makakapigil sa pamamayagpag ng taong ito at ng kanyang mga Kuyang na sana po ay ngayon na. Mga sawa na sa katiwalian. CC: 1. The Ombudsman 2.

The best thing you can do is put up a bridge in that river so the kids will be safe in their journey to school everyday! Dont wait that one of this kids will have a tragic accident crossing that river everyday! Make some action now before its too late!!!

FB LINK:

https://www.facebook.com/becomingfilipino/videos/1592929764305556/

For a lot of Filipinos education is important. In fact it is so important that they will go to great lengths just to get to school...

I stayed over at my friends place in Mamabuaya, Cagayan de Oro, and proceeded to go on a morning trek down to the riverside in the neighbouring Brgy. Bayagna. What did I find there?

18 kids (ages 5-14) on their way to school...

This is a raw look at their journey...

Turns out none of the young kids have raincoats and none of the older kids have ""payungs"" (Umbrellas). Even if it rains they still take the epic journey to school and try to change into drier clothes after crossing the river.

Hearing this...

I spent all day today creating 18 ""rain packs!"" One for each kid! 

What was in them:
- A thick plastic to waterproof
- A waterproof lunch box
- A fresh big towel (to dry and change with)
- Lots of little ""baon"" goodies
- Mirror, Comb, soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste (so the kids can look pogi for school... They were all bathing in the river when I first met them this morning)
- The young kids now have rain coats. The older kids have payungs.
- School kits for each kid (paper, pen, pencil, markers, sharpener)
- 100 peso for each kid to purchase whatever makes them happy

One day at a time, One school journey at a time... #BecomingFilipino

Super Apir to these kids!!

*** I didn\'t film much interaction and much of the distribution of packs. Those were moments that I really just wanted my barkada camerman and I to really experience individually. It was really beautiful to see the kids shocked that I was there handing them packages after seeing me in the morning, and then really show appreciation and excitement'","2015-06-23 08:25:34","5","14"

Ako po sa ngalan ng humigit kumulang 350 kabahayan sa aming lugar kasama na rin ang iba pang mga karatig barangay na makikinabang na pawang dumadaan dito ay buong kapakumbabaang nagpapasalamat sa mabilisang pag aksyon ng DPWH sa aming panawagan na mai-upgrade ang aming kalsada at tulay, dahil palagi po ito nalulubog sa tubig baha lalo na kung tag ulan. Tunay nga po na kayo ang pag asa ng mga mamamayan na nangangarap na mapaganda at mapaayos ang isang lugar. Noong nakaraang biyernes po ay nakipag ugnayan na sa amin ang DPWH Bulacan-1st District kasunod raw po nito ay ang pagsusukat/survey ng nasabing pagawain. Kanila pong nakita ng aktwal ang labis na kahirapan dito na matagal na namin pinapangarap na maging maayos. Dahil nasa sentro po kami ng Lungsod at tabing palengke nais po sana namin na makamtan na makapasok ang mga pangunahing sasakyan gaya ng Ambulansya, Pamatay Sunog, Brgy. Patrol, Brgy. Garbage Truck, Pulis Mobil, School Service, at iba pa na gaya nito. Samo at dalangin po namin na hindi po abutan ng panahon ng tag ulan at tag baha ang aming panawagan labis po kasi namin itong pinapangambahan, umaabot po kasi hanggang sikmura ang lebel o taas ng tubig baha dito lalo na kung tag ulan. Kinakabahan rin po kaming mga mamamayan na baka abutan pa ng election ban bagay na lalong magpapahirap sa sitwasyon ng aming kalsada at tulay. 

Maraming maraming salamat pong muli sa inyong lahat. Hangad po naming lahat ang patuloy na tagumpay ng DPWH sa mga proyekto tungo sa kaunlaran ng ating Pamayanan. Sumainyo po ang Dakilang Pagpapala mula sa Panginoong Diyos na Maylikha.

Gawa lamang sa mga lumang relis ng tren at kahoy. Marupok na rin ang pundasyon nito.
Ang tulay na ito ang nagsisilbing tawiran ng mga mamamayan na nanggagaling sa maraming lugar para magdala ng produkto sa bayan at upang ang mga estudyante ay makarating sa mga paaralan. Ito ang Tulay ng Pangarap na isang banungot sa mga nagdaang dekada. Mabibigat na Truck ng tubo at mga pampasaherong jeep ang buwis buhay na tumatawid dito  upang makarating sa bayan.
Sa pagdaan ng panahon, lalong tumitindi ang  banta ng kalikasan. Ang bagyo at ang pagbaha ang pangunahing suliranin ng mga mamamayan na gumagamit sa tulay na ito.
Ilang Buhay na ang naibuwis at ilang buhay pa ba ng kailangang ibuwis bago pa mabigyang pansin ang problemang ito.
Maraming ahensya na kaming nilapitan subalit wala kaming aksyong natatanggap.  Nakakalungkot isipin na sa kabila ng mga balitang pag angat at pag unlad ng Bayan ng Sagay, nakakubli ang pighati at dalamhati ng mga biktima ng tulay na ito.

I hope this would reach the Executive Assistant of Secretary Rogelio Singson.

I am Neil Arana, Project Development Manager of Habitat for Humanity Philippines handling North Luzon projects. One of the projects I am currently handling is the 5-hectare property located at Brgy. Concepcion, Bacolor Pampanga and  has been donated by Atty. Estelito Mendoza for socialized housing. 

The property is inside the Megadike system. However, Philvocs did not issue us a certification to secure an ECC with the Environmental Management Bureau that we could build houses in the property, UNLESS there would be a mitigation measures to be undertaken to address the flow of lahar in case of typhoons or strong rains. 

We have discussed this issue with our management and we would like to know if we could add additional walls on top of the MEGADIKE or  build our own wall parallel to the megadike.

We brought up this matter to Atty. Estelito Mendoza himself and we are forwarding his email to you for your reference.He is also likewise included in this thread.

We hope you could advise on how to address this so we could start the project as soon as possible if it is viable. Likewise, we would appreciate for a meeting with you on your most convenient time. I may be reached at telephone numbers written below. Thank you so much Sir.

"CFMC-20151096","Please be informed that the construction of the Mendiola bridge at Siocon River, Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte has been delayed for quite sometime. The contractor - Vicente T. Lao Construction (VTLC) has not made any substantial progress since they started the project during the last quarter 2014. From November 2014 until May this year, the Siocon River had very shallow waters due to the occurrence of drought, which would have been the right time for the contractor to fast-track the project. But for a long time, they managed to construct only a platform for their crane, which at this time, serves as a choke point of the swollen flood waters of the Siocon River. The platform, now constructed halfway of the river's width, acts as an obstruction to the free flow of water, which would cause a backflow, overflow the riverbank, and eventually inundate several low-lying barangays. For this reason, this representation - the designated MDRRMO of Siocon - earnestly request intervention of DPWH to direct the contractor for the immediate deconstruction of the dam-platform to prevent potential disastrous flooding of the municipality. We will be submitting a report to DPWH Regional Office, cc: Office of the Honorable Secretary. Thank you.""","2015-07-07 08:21:45","5","14"

Re-routing of traffic is being done in close coordination with the Mandaluyong Traffic Management Office whenever concrete pouring activities for the remaining length of the reinforced concrete box culvert are in progress.

Something is not right in Eastern Samar.... There is a huge billboard proclaiming a P35 million ""preventive maintenance"" project covering a stretch of national highway that should be the envy of so many other LgUs.... Because it remains in good shape.
And yet the DPWH will let a contractor dig it up and repave it?? For P35 Million?
I don\'t know if you have even traversed this stretch of highway but please do and soon. Before admin opponents pounce on it as an example of questionable projects as the elections near. And before the jackhammer does its work and actually destroys what is still good road! 
I know you are an honorable man Secretary Singson but this Eastern Samar project stinks. I wouldn\'t be surprised if some investigative reporter picks up on this issue and exposes it on national tv or in the dailies. Then DAANG MATUWID\'s critiques will have a heyday. Why and how do these things happen anyway? Even under your watch?
(Ellen Tordesillas this is something for Vera Files if you ask me. Cecilia Victoria O. Drilon unless you want to pick this up? )
My cellphone ran out of battery due to the video clips I took of this road so if you need them just let me know. Because some people may not be telling you what you need to know. 
We have never met but one member of the Cabinet, DOTC Secretary Abaya, knows me quite well and how insistent I can be when I pick up on an issue, since a few years back I picked up on an issue involving Secretary Abaya\'s brother Peter, taking the latter\' side, and didn\'t let go. I feel as strongly about this matter as I did about the case of then DENR Usec Peter Abaya...
So I hope you or your staff can explain why a highway as good as this one from Lawaan to Buenavista will be dug up to the tune of P35 million - which could be better spent building roads where none exist at the moment. And I suspect there are still a lot of places in Eastern Samar which fit the bill...

"CFMC-20151160","Dear Mr. Secretary,

This is with regards to the C6 road which actually, for us living in Rizal area, is our best route and option going to our offices in McKinley and maybe to South for others. Would appreciate if you could do some repairs on its stretch as path holes are becoming worser everyday. I know there have been plans of upcoming rehab and we have been seeing this coz houses were already been demolished in preparation for the road widening (i guess?)...but we couldnt endure the worsening road condition and am pretty sure this will worsen as rainy season gets nearer. We really need to see some resolution to this from your department, may it be temporary patching or permanent. Please look into the areas of Arenda in Taytay up to the Bagong Calzada road which i think is part of Taguig City. Of course you may also consider the whole stretch of C6 as well...Hope you understand our sentiments on this matter as we do hope to see this problem resolved in few days...thank you mr secretary...'","2015-07-08 10:09:00","4","6"

Dear DPWH, I am complaining regarding the VERY POOR timing of the ongoing road construction in Minglanilla. Commuting from Tungkop to Poblacion Minglanilla cebu alone would take 30mins to an hour. What a hassle! I acknowledge that our public roads need improvement and construction works are (eventually) necessary but would appreciate if you can help me understand a few things: 1. Is the road construction project URGENT? As far as I'm concerned, the roads are passable, albeit uneven and a bit bumpy. Also, what I think should be a greater priority is the drainage problem in Tunghaan. A little rain and you can see a lot of flooding on the roads already. 2. Why wasn't it scheduled during SUMMER BREAK? I know your agency is capable enough of thinking road constructions should be done in the summer when there's less traffic and hassle. Plus, the sunny weather would help dry and harden the cement concrete. The rains in June-August will paralyze some of the operations for a few hours and/or days, further delaying the construction and the public's misery. So WHY WAS IT DONE NOW (at such an inconvenient time)??? So those were my complaints/feedback. I appreciate if you can respond to my concerns at a sooner time. After all, it is the government's (and its agencies') responsibility to be transparent and accountable of its transactions and doings to the public. Thank you. Rechel C.

Dear Sir:

May we respectfully refer, for appropriate action, the attached email of Messrs.

VIII) on the alleged malversation of PSF funds intended for the members of the DPWH Reg. VIII Employees Multi-Purpose Cooperative (DREEMC) who were victims of Typhoon Yolanda.

Kindly inform Messrs. Polo and Tolentino of any action taken on the matter, copy furnished this Office.

Thank you and best regards.


Very truly yours,

ATTACHED EMAIL MESSAGES:

Secretary Singson at mga kagalang-galang na opisyal ng DPWH,

Lingid sa kaalaman ng mga empleyado ng DPWH Region 8, binawasan yung nakalaan sana na pera mula sa Office of the President at pinambayad sa loans ng kooperatiba ng DPWH na pinamamahalaan ng mga tauhan ni MRS. SUSAN DUERO. Tuloy ang natanggap ng mga kawani ng ahensiya ay kalahati na lang nung financial assistance, yung iba pa nga ay wala ng natanggap sapagkat kinuha lahat sa accounting department. Tama po ba na yung financial assistance ay pinaki-alaman na accounting at hindi binigay yung iba sa mga empleyado ng walang paalam? Paano nalang po kami makaka bangon mula sa Yolanda kung pati financial assistance galling sa Presidente ay pinakikialaman ni MRS. DUERO? Tulungan niyo po sana kami Secretary Singson.


Sa pangunguna ni MRS DUERO ay binawasan yung financial assistance naming. Marami kaming mga empleyado ng district at members ng DREEMC, ibinawas yung existing loans naming sa financial assistance from the president. Wala kaming magawa kasi accounting office ang may control na ang Chief ay si MRS DUERO.  Pano yung reconstruction ng mga bahay namin kung ganon?

Ang ibang district naman ay sobrang tagal nung pag process ng payroll, hindi aasikasuhin kung walang ibibigay kay ROXANNE SALVATIERRA at CINDY FUENTES SARMEN.

Sobra na ang accounting office ng DPWH Region 8. Hindi makatao si MRS. DUERO at ang kanyang mga empleyado. Pano nalang kaming Yolanda victims?'","2015-08-04 10:43:31","1","3"

Ang ganitong klaseng proyekto ay hindi nararapat na ipatupad at ipagpatuloy lalu pa't ang proyekto ay nasa ibabaw ng isang flyover na bumabagtas sa PASIG RIVER na magdudulot ng karagdagang bigat sa ibabaw ng naturang tulay.., maliban pa sa pang araw-araw na traffic ng NAGLALAKIHANG TRUCKS na maaaring magdulot ng damage sa pundasyon o maging sa kabuuan ng naturang flyover.

Though maraming nahuhulog na mga sasakyan sa skyway pero hindi pwedeng mag taas ng fence ang skyway dahil iyon ay magdadagdag ng bigat sa ibabaw ng skyway na maaring magdulot ng collapse ng nasabing structure. Same principle should be applied to all fly-over.

I received a message from an employee in the DPWH who was inspired enough to share the video with others in the government office. I guess it must have been seen by some superiors to the point where they went to actually go reconnaissance the area.
*** I RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM SOMEONE WORKING IN THE DPWH WHO FORWARDED ME THIS...
*** (I have removed any names and parts of the message because I simply feel it is important I share this... but I don't want to have any politics involved)
Read below...
""Result of the investigation revealed that an estimated 50 elementary school children and high school students from sition Kitara, Brgy. Lingating, Baungon, Bukidnon are going to and from Barangays Bayanga and Mambuaya Elementary School/High School, Cagayan de Oro City everyday just to be in school. The use of two (2) bamboo rafts is the only mode transportation in crossing the river, and they still have to climb the vertical bank of the river to reach their homes. This is the unchanging situation the people are embracing daily that puts so much risk in their lives. 
To address this concern... (***removed names) suggested that they include in their local infrastructure project (LIP) the following: 
1. Construction of 160 l.m. Hanging Bridge and Access Road, Brgy. Bayanga, Cagayan de Oro City to Sitio Kitara, Brgy. Lingating, Baungon, Bukidnon. 
2. Construction of 124 l.m. Hanging Bridge and Access Road, Brgy. Mambuaya, Cagayan de Oro City to Sitio Macabundol, Brgy. Danatag, Baungon, Bukidnon. 
3. Construction of 124 l.m. Hanging Bridge and Access Road, Zone 5 Sitio Aura Brgy. Mambuaya to Sitio Guimara, Brgy. Langawon, Baungon, Bukidnon. 
The project shall be implemented and completed in 2016 so that school kids will no longer take the risks in climbing the vertical bank of the river accident can be avoided. 
Thank you.

------------------------------------
This makes me smile! smile emoticon
I had lots of messages from people asking how to help these kids. Well turns out a few people in the DPWH were inspired enough to really do something about the dangerous commute to school the kids had to go through everyday. 
I look forward to a year from now making another video... of the kids walking across a bridge safely to school smile emoticon

To Whom It May Concern:
I am a graduate of BS Applied Physics in the University of the Philippines Los Ba\xc3\xb1os (UPLB) and am very interested in any open positions commensurate to my qualifications that are available at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).
I worked as an intern at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) in Seismological Observation and Prediction Division during summer of 2013 (April-May 2013) and as a project based Science Research Assistant at SENSLOPE under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) from May 2014 to September 2014. My experiences involved conducting a lot of researches, developments and analysis. I have written a lot of research papers during my undergraduate years in UPLB which are good factors in drafting and writing accurate and adequate reports and giving out precise interpretations and recommendations. I have managed doing tons of paper works which shows high administrative and organizational skills. More importantly, I am willing and open to any related tasks that might be assigned to me and expect that it would be with full of dedication and excellence.
It would be a great privilege to meet you and discuss my qualifications for working at the DPWH. I believe that my trainings and experiences are enough to make a valuable contribution. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

"CFMC-20151550","Dear Secretary Singson: Magandang Buhay! This is to bring attention to your Office the incidents happening at Mt. Province DEO. Honorable Secretary, you have changed the DPWH image of being corrupt, but in MPDEO still a corrupt agency! The following are part of the practices being done by the Officials at the Agency especially the Chief, Administrative Section: 1. On July 23, 2015, a DPWH loader has fallen along the Talubin-Barlig Road. The operator is a Job Order - Norman Fonite and was in the trip ticket. However, the one who operated it in the time of falling is another Job Order named Samuel Kenept. In the police blotter & local newspaper, the Chief of the Maintenance Section and the inspector reported that a permanent employee in the person of Dencio Comafay was the operator when the loader fell. In fact, Mr. Comafay has an approved trip ticket for the Dump truck to operate at the same roadline at same dates. Due to conscience, Dencio spoke and he said he was pressured by Domingo Pumecha and Janet Valencerina to admit. These two personalities at the MPDEO even falsified the trip tickets, travel orders and the logbooks just to show that it was DENCIO COMAFAY. After sleepless nights and advises this 2nd week of August, Dencio Comafay had his sworn statement to tell the truth. It was also this time that Mr. Pumecha retracted his report at the police when in fact, there was a prior copy of the blotter that was secured. Mr. Pumecha and his men said after thorough investigation it was not Dencio. Mr Secretary, how can that be a thorough investigation when there were falsifications done? 2. WORST SCENARION Mr Secretary is the death of Mr. Arthur Padchonga, a JOB Order worker at MPDEO. Natabunan po siya sa pinapagawang kabiti ng Administrative Officer, Janet A. Valencerina, wife of the Chief of the Construction Division Clifton Valencerina, bagman of the RD at DPWH-CAR. Kasama po ng namtay ang isa ring JO. Nung mag imbsetiga ang pulisya, makikita sa logbook ng DPWH na nabura ang pangalan nila. Sinabi pa ng AO na hindi empleyado dun. Masakit po sa pamilya ni Arthur na araw-araw pumapasok ang ama sa MPDEO, ngayong namatay sinabing di empleyado. Ang pagtanggal ng maraming matagal ng JOs para mapalitan ng kamag-anak, pagdoktor sa publication ang mismong AO position noon at pag bypass sa DE ng DEO... takot lang ang mga empleyado doon na magsalita kasi may pera siya... Ito at marami pang magics ang ginagawa ng AO sa MPDEO. Honorable Secretary, ito ba ang tinatahak ng dpwh na daang matuwid? Sir, lifestyle check din sana.. We hope that the people of Bontoc, employees of DPWH Bontoc be freed from these abusive, corrupt Officals! Copies of the local newspaper and documents that were originally signed by both DPWSH and the JOs will be sent directly to your Office for your reference. These we know especially the contract are now being falsified to show that Padchonga has not been employed thereat. Thank you and mabuhay !'","2015-09-01 14:42:52","1","3"

This is right beside the Mang Inasal Restaurant. Temporary solution like patching of the pothole with gravel was done by the local government couple of times but this solution doesn't last long and is unsafe due to the big and heavy trucks passing by which causes the gravel to dismiss from ground and hit anything nearby. There has been instances where the gravel hit a glass wall and it broke. Another instance is it hit a parked vehicle and caused damage to its paint. As well as hitting a person standing on the sidewalk. We don't want to experience and see more accidents in the coming days so we hope that this problem could be solved as soon as possible. Thank you very much and more power! Best Regards, David Lo""","2015-09-01 14:52:13","4","8"
"CFMC-20151553","Greetings from U.P. Diliman! I am Ms. Nanette S. Baena, the current Supervisor of Centennial Residence Halls. I am managing one of the big dormitories here in Diliman campus and it happened that we are located beside a very busy road with daily heavy traffic of large trucks. We are near the C.P. Garcia portal gate, fronting Krus na Ligas where numerous accidents happen. Some of our own residents are already victims of vehicular accidents in this infamous area. We have incident reports that can support this claim, including one dormer who is still waiting for his surgery. He was hit and suffered leg fractures last 14 August 2015. Just this noon time, another motorcycle was crushed by a big truck, good that the motorcycle driver survived. In this connection, I would like to plead for an immediate assistance from your good office of any concrete intervention to deter the motorists and pedestrians alike to be victims of vehicular accidents in this area. It is known to be ""takaw disgrasya"" and ""buwis buhay"" street. Thank you in advance for whatever support your office can extend to the community of U.P. Diliman. Respectfully yours, N.

"CFMC-20151566","gud day po mga sir. may itatanong lang po ako tungkol sa concreting ng dating may aspalto. binutas butas na po ung aspalto, akala namin eh babakbakin dahil may idinating na backhoe. eh pinatungan naman po ng buhangin at saka daw ikoconcrete. di po ba iyon magpaparupok sa semento. parang palaman napapanis. sobrang taas na po at naiwan sa baba mga bahay. sa palagay ko nagtipid lng kya kunwari lng babakbakin. It was originally a provincial road as seen in old titles and map but turned to a barangay road now. It is a 500m road rehabilitation I think to replace the asphalt road here in Brgy Maturanoc, Guimba, Nueva Ecija. I have two concerns about the construction sir. It is only a barangay road now and its elevation is too high after the construction is done, another sir is that i don't see that putting sands on top of an asphalt before concreting will not affect its stability. I'll be glad to hear from you sir since i'm not familiar with engineering works especially road construction. Thank you very much sir. Good day again sir. An Engineer already showed up here a while ago and showed the plan for the road rehabilitation project here. Additional query sir, take note sir that the asphalt is already jack hammered and holes are made before they put sand on top of it. What we think is that it should be done only when the asphalt is for removal. The road is not in a flood prone area so i think there is no need to elevate the road too much cause it will just add to its instability. If that should be the case then we have to rehabilitate also our houses to get along with the new elevation of the road after the construction. Thank you again sir. Mga sir engineers sa good dpwh. ngayun po k-12 na curriculum hndi po yta sa primary education ang need dagdagan. bka dapat po sa college na 2lad ng engineering. di po ba dapat pag aralan muna magiging epekto sa mga tao nung gagawing project. nagkaroon po muna sana ng feasibility study o kinausap man lng mga concern citizen na taxpayer kung ok po ba ung isasagawa. gustong gusto naming gumanda daan mga ginagalang na engineer pero bka po pwd pasyalan nyo ngayun ung naumpisahan na at kung ok po sa inyo o mga engineer d2 at maipaliwanag ang magandang epekto sa amin eh wala na po kami masasabi.""","2015-09-01 15:56:28","4","6"

"CFMC-20151594","Hai,

Below is the info on the Project that I was talking about. 

The first time my sister went to Palawan 2nd DEO was to inform them of the impending collapse of the road slope in front of  their house, hoping that it would be promptly remedied.  Actually, someone immediately came to look into her complaint. After a couple of weeks, though, nothing was done - and that side of the road had already collapsed damaging their fence.  She went back to the District the 2nd time and was again received well by the person manning the Complaint Desk and was assured of immediate attention.  

She made another  visit last August 10 and made several calls/texts after that and was always assured that immediate action will be taken but until now no actual repair was done by the contractor.  If left unattended, and now with the monsoon rains, the damage could get worse, affecting not just our fence but the road itself.

"CFMC-20151612","Ang post na ito ay naglalayong ipaabot sa kinauukulan ang isa sa mga suliranin na nagiging dahilan ng kahirapan sa mga motorista na bumabaybay sa Brgy. Tiling, Cauayan, Negros Occidental papuntang bayan ng Cauayan. Sa nasasakupan ng Brgy. Tiling ay may binungkal na dalawang maliliit na tulay na kung tutuusin ay hindi umabot sa sampung metro (10 meters) ang bawat isa. Ito ay sinimulang bungkalin at isara sa trapiko halos mahigit isang taon na ang nakalilipas (more or less). Naging sagabal ito sa daloy ng trapiko sa bahaging ito ng National Highway dahil sa kawalan ng tamang bantay. Isa pa sa nagpalala sa sitwasyon ay ang kasalukuyang kalagayan ng mga tulay na ito na ayon sa aming pagmamatyag ay may ganitong problema: 1. Kawalan ng tinatawag na Project Information Board na naglalaman ng petsa kung kalian inumpisahan at matatapos ang proyekto, pangalan ng contractor ng proyekto, kabuuhang halaga ng proyekto at lugar ng proyekto; 2. Sabay na binungkal at isinara ang dalawang tulay at sabay rin na hindi ginagawa; 3. Kawalan ng nakaduty na mga \xe2\x80\x9cFlagmen\xe2\x80\x9d na magbabantay sa mga paparating na sasakyan at magkontrol sa trapiko; 4. Kawalan ng mga warning device kung gabi na maaring maging dahilan ng mga di inaasahang aksidente; 5. Sa mahigit isang taon na pagsara sa mga tulay na ito, at matapos ilagay ang mga kongretong poste, nawalan na ng nagtatrabaho; 6. Kawalan ng mga equipments na magpapadali sa pagtrabaho \xe2\x80\x93 nagkaroon ng heavey equipment, sira naman at yon lang ang tinatrabaho ng iisang tao sa tuwing kami ay dumadaan Sa mga dahilang ito, nais naming isangguni sa inyong Opisina, bilang tagapangasiwa ng mga proyektong katulad nito ang mga sumusunod: 1. Kailan maipagpapatuloy ang pagtrabaho sa mga tulay na ito? 2. Kailan matatapos ang proyektong ito? 3. Bakit walang nakapaskil na pangalan ng contractor sa lugar ng proyekto na sa alituntunin ng Department of Public Works and Highways, bawat proyekto ay dapat nakalagay ang pangalan ng contractor? 4. Bakit kailangang sabay na bungkalin at isara ang dalawang tulay kung di naman pala sabay na gagawin? Bilang mga mamamayan na palaging bumabaybay sa pangunahing kalsadang ito, nais naming maisaayos ang mga ito upang mawala ang mga agam-agam ng naming sa kinauukulan.

DIRECTOR ELIZABETH P. PILORIN
Stakeholders Relations Service
Department of Public Works and Highways
Manila

Dear DIRECTOR PILORIN:

In all candor and humility owed to an informed judgment, I stand corrected in my August 13, 2015 letter denial of my November 7, 2014 letter ""seeking the implementation of our requested Project in our Local Government Unit (LGU) which was already approved by the DPWH.""

It is almost a year since this project was begun, the highest and biggest infrastructure undertaking in the history of San Enrique had it materialized. As the Local Chief Executive I would have been very proud to initiate and implement such a project under my administration for the benefit of my town mates and constituents.

I realize on hindsight, however, that since day one (1) of this project - (with Transaction ID: LR-CFMC-20151231) seeking Presidential intercession and posing great inconvenience to the Office of the President and the DPWH Main Office, to include its Regional and Provincial Arms in Region VI - I was being misled by certain individuals feigning and claiming close connections with Malacanang, DBM and DPWH. To continue a deal that has become untenable and muddled would practically shame and embarrass my office had I persisted. The many grey areas and procedural inconsistencies practically caused my disinterest as I wanted the transaction to be transparent and to follow the legal process. Hence, my decision to disengage and drop the entire project.

Then, there is this paramount concern. That we conducted a public bidding on the belief that funds were to be made available soonest can neither be denied nor disowned. It stood to reason, however, that the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) did not award any contractor pending the notice of release of funds, which only showed that the bidding was above board and done in good faith.

Thank you so much for giving due course to this letter. I feel vindicated by the fact that, following the Tuwid na Daan precept, the Local Government Unit (LGU) of the Municipality of San Enrique has been spared from the scandal of implementing a highly questionalble project.

My sincerest apology. God bless.

Very truly yours,


BGEN RAMONA PALABRICA-GO (Ret)

"CFMC-20151760","The Ribsuan bridge along Baguio - Bauang road had already been closed to trucks in the last quarter of 2014. It was reopened to all types of vehicles early 2015 but again closed to trucks last September 17,2015. Earlier this year, we noticed a DPWH signage posted on both ends of the bridge to wit: REPLACEMENT OF (PERMANENT) WEAK BRIDGE, RIBSUAN BRIDGE CONTRACTOR: ST. GERRARD CONSTRUCTION DATE STARTED: MARCH 5, 2015 CONTRACT DURATION: 182 CALENDAR DAYS CONTRACT COST: PHP 59,427,143.31 IMPLEMENTING OFFICE: DPWH, REGION I What saddens us is that the contract duration for the replacement bridge is almost over, but no semblance yet of a new bridge to be erected is visible,not a single post whatsoever can be seen. What can be seen in the area is that they are repairing a very small portion (12 sqm) of the pavement of the old steel bridge, and its taking them forever. We haul our cement from Holcim at Bacnotan, La Union; our hollowblocks from Bauang, and concrete aggregates from Naguillan. We waste so much time and fuel if we pass thru Marcos Highway, aside from the danger it poses to life and property because of its very steep terrain. We also aggravate the traffic at the city proper if all trucks pass thru Marcos high way. Finally, Naguillan/Quirino highway is a major thoroughfare, there is no wisdom in closing a portion of it to trucks because this will negatively impact on businesses.

SIR: The discussion thread above is the AYAGA, CAGAYAN/APAYAO boundary road. While the Apayao part has been cemented, THIS PARTICULAR stretch on the CAGAYAN portion has been forgotten and neglected for as long as this road has been established. This is impacting the residents of Flora, ta. Marcela, Apayao and Ayaga, Cagayan. This has a tremendous pabigat to everyone because this is the only exit and entry road to and out of Flora and Sta Marcela where hundreds of students have to pass through in order to get to their colleges and schools, and to the merchants and in general the local economy. Rumurs have it that the Gov. Bulut, Jr. of Apayao even offered to the Governor of Cagayan that they complete this as a oint project. However, I firmly and strongly believe, this rad is UNDER your jusrisdiction. THIS particular road should be a priority, and we do not understtand why it hasn't been. Please look at the pictures on the link before this message. This road is almost unpassable during the rainy seasons.

"CFMC-20151782","Magandang hapon po. Sana po mabigyang pansin naman ang kanto ng Camaro St at Commonwealth Ave sa Fairview, QC. Napakahirap tumawid dun na palaging tantiyahan. May pagkakataon lang kapag stop ang traffic light sa kalapit na kanto naman ng Regalado Ave/Fairview Center Mall at Commonwealth Ave. Pero sa southbound lang makatawid ng maayos ng ilang segundo. Pag galing sa northbound side ang tatawid o patawid northboun dun mula sa center island e napakahirap. 

Ang mga motorista pa naman karamihan parang ayaw magbigay daan sa pedestrians at gusto lagi bumuwelo na ng takbo. Sampung taon na ako sa Fairview pero wala man lang road sign para sa motorista na palapit sila sa pedestrian crossing at magdahan dahan. Burado na nga ang naunang pedestrian lane na pintura pero dapat magkabilaan side ng red box ang may pedestrian crossing.

Pinakamainam sana e lagyan din ng stoplight dun para sa kaligtasan namin gaya sa kanto Regalado Ave at North Fairview Park Subd. Para naman pagbigyan pedestrian. Huwag naman sana isa na namang footbridge ang maging solusyon gaya sa Regalado/Fairview Center Mall. Huwag naman puro pabor sa motorista na para sa tig 4 lanes na kalsada e di pa kami makatawid maayos at lagi na lang paakyatin footbridge. Kung sana may makasagot man lang sa mensahe ko na ito at makarating sa mga kinauukulan. Salamat po.'","2015-10-07 10:03:36","4","8"

Dear Sir/Madam, 
I am writing these regarding my application to the Engineer II position at DPWH - Ilocos Sur 1st District Engineering Office, Bantay, Ilocos Sur (Item Number: ENG2-126-2015, ENG2-127-2015, ENG2-128-2015, ENG2-129-2015 or ENG2-130-2015). Last October 09, 2015 I follow-up the status of my application to Ms. Noemi, A.O. IV of DPWH - Ilocos Sur 1st District Engineering Office (Bantay, Ilocos Sur). According to Ms. Noemi I failed the evaluation because they choice applicants that have highest rating in the Board Exam. To ensure that the best and most competent professionals are appointed to vacancies in the DPWH, and to give a fair chance to all applicants D.O. 113 series of 2015 was created which is the Selection Crtiteria on the Evaluation of Applicants. D.O. 113 indicate that the Applicants was rated based on four (4) criteria: (1) Work Experience \xe2\x80\x93 10%; (2) Education and Training \xe2\x80\x93 40%; (3) Experience and Outstanding Accomplishments \xe2\x80\x93 10%; and, (4) Potential and Personality Traits \xe2\x80\x93 40%. Annex B of D.O. 113 explained that the Education and Training Criteria (40%) was given points as prescribed below: Minimum Educational Requirement \xe2\x80\x93 60 points Honors \xe2\x80\x93 15 points Board Rating \xe2\x80\x93 10 points Other Degrees \xe2\x80\x93 10 points Training \xe2\x80\x93 5 points I know that I have a lowest Board Rating but with the help of my two Masteral Degree (Master of Science in Civil Engineering and Master in Public Administration) the points i lose in having lowest board rating is recoup. Therefore can i ask a copy of the results of the Annex F of D.O. 113 series of 2015 (Evaluation Matrix) to know how I am evaluated and requesting your good office for re-evaluation. I have attached my credentials for your references and further evaluation. I also pass the Computer Literacy Exam last July 25, 2015 at DPWH Central Office. Thank you and God Bless!

"CFMC-20151845","We made a private road in our farm last year 2014 so that our vehicle can do down the hill and park near the house since we carry heavy things and farm products. Now, we cannot pass in our road anymore because the road is impassable. It was too high and no culvert according to my husband since he went to the visit our farm but had to park the car in the roadside. There was even no means for a person to pass, how much more for our 4-wheel vehicle.I talked over the phone with the contractor, Annabi Cagalawan of Cagalawan Enterprises but she said it is not in their scope in the contract. She blamed DPWH personnel who she said is responsible for not looking into the effects of the new road construction to our property road. I am writing this complaint because, I am seeking that our problem be resolved. We were very happy when we knew that the main road was cemented but then we are more sad because we cannot get inside our property anymore. Hoping for your immediate action. 

I forgot to put the details of my previous mail. Our property is in Malanang Opol Misamis Oriental. We bought last year a portion of the land from our neighbor for our entrance since our property is in the inner lot. We spent a lot in making the private road so that our car can go downhill to our property. But now, we cannot pass because the road is too high with a canal-like structure (no culvert or cover to the side) which is also dangerous. The contractor - Cagalawan Enterprises said, it is not their concern since it is not part of the scope of their contract. According to her, it was the neglect of DPWH surveyors. Our entrance is almost 3 meters wide facing the mainroad and there are flaglets to distinguish that it is an entrance and there is a private road going down the hill. The private road can easily be seen since the main road is on the higher grounds. Now our property road is impassable. If only there is a connection from the main road to our road by way of covering the ""canal"" so that the vehicles/persons will not fall. Please help us resolve this situation.'","2015-10-13 14:25:21","4","6"

Why not change the contractor if they are not performing to expedite the project thus avoiding people of getting sick and having the road again passable. There are 3 separate diggings in the stretch of Luzon Ave in Sampaloc and the people concern has no sense of urgency.

Where are our taxes going? What's the timetable to complete the project? Please advise.

Your response was a real surprise just meeting one week later, two of your employees inviting me for a clarification to my problem with the local watercompany in Tacloban City, LMWD, in charge for Palo-Leyte. Today I had the clearing talk with your local representative of DPWH, Mr. Ramon Bibero, in Tacloban City, district one. Mr. Ramon was informing me that DPWH has nothing to do with the local Water-Company LMWD who is in charge of our water supply. Furthermore he could make a very helpful telefon call to LMWD for speeding up our water connection to the mainpipe in our brgy. Cabarasan Guti, a service that had be paid some two month ago. That is why I want to appologuize my mistake that your department is not in charge for delivering the water for the people. And it was my mistake writing to a wrong adress. But anyway I want to thank your for the help we got from you, to listen to our furthermost infrastructure problems with watersupply in the brgy. Mr. Ramon Bibero did a very helpful job in finding a good solution and response, and we are very grateful for the work you do for just normal people like we are and also thanks to all your people from DPWH in district one of Leyte, who really take care for the public. That is why we can see forward now, for a good infrastructure in future, also in our brgy. that was almost 100% devastated by Taifun Yolanda just two years ago. Yours sincerely Roland Logo

"CFMC-20151977","Dear All 

First of all, we would like to thank you for the good leadership you are showing to our village - Moonwalk Village Phase One Paranaque City. 

The creek along Aldrin Street between Airport is now ongoing and hopefully we would be able to see its full completion by end of this year. 

But one thing we observed is that they only completed the other side of the creek (Airport side) and left the other side ( Moonwalk resident side) unattended. 
This prompt me to call the attention of PHIMRA President (Dino) and the worker which until now no construction is happening. 

Our area is always devastated every time there is a strong typhoon and flood is starting in Aldrin Street considering it is the lowest area of Moonwalk Village Paranaque City. 

We would like to appeal in your good leadership and help ensure that the resident portion will also be completed. 

I was told this is a project of DPWH and prompted me to seek for your kind assistance. I am not sure5 but they are currently doing a rehab/ repair of the Creek Barangay Moonwalk Phase1 Paranaque City near Merville.

Thank you and God Bless.'","2015-11-23 11:16:07","4","7"

With the summer season approaching, one feels the need to have the roads completed. One road leading from the main road to Libaong White Beach and resorts like Amarela has been totally destroyed, it was partially concreted but the contractor ripped that up turning it into a dangerous road and with the vast number of visitors coming to these beaches in the approaching high season, this is a recipe for disaster.

"CFMC-20151992","Dear Sir or Madam: Greetings! I would like to complain about a recently repaired stretch of road here in Bacolod City, specifically the Alijis Murcia road as this road had several sections repaired (finished around last month). Although it was finished only recently (last month), the cement portions have began to peel off revealing the stones underneath used in making the concrete. I have inquired around and the people I asked said that this is called scaling and should not happen for a long time. I am complaining as a private citizen as I have noted that several road repairs in Bacolod recently finished also exhibit this poor quality of construction. I am not sure if this is the same company that you contracted but I hope that you give this the attention it deserves. Under the ""Daang Matuwid,"" we hoped that the quality of public construction would be better than the previous. If this shoddy and poor quality work continues and is allowed to continue by the DPWH, our country is going nowhere and all the slogans we see on your website and on TV are simply just that. Thank you very much and I very respectfully hope you give this your consideration. I did not include my name so that as a private citizen, I don\'t get pulled into the politics of public bidding and construction work. I did leave my email for our continued correspondence.

Mr. Lisay is complaining the on going Yawa Bridge Construction located in Brgy. Rawis and Bunot Legaspi City, Albay. As per caller, the construction started 4-6 months ago under Albay 2nd DEO but has been transferred already to Region V Projects. 

He said, ""This is a major bridge na magdudugtong sa Albay 1st at Legaspi. Based on my observation, hindi pantay yung girder. Yung isang side mataas at yung kabilang side mababa. Worried ako na baka buhusan lang ng semento bago nila isunod ang paglalagay ng slab."" He also noticed a plywood covering a space on the side. 

He also wants to clarify if the road project (approaches the bridge) would be a component project of Yawa Bridge Construction. He added, ""Di ba hiwalay ang bidding ng road project sa bridge project? Bakit kasabay siya? at 200-400 meters ang layo from the bridge ang i-elevate nila ng two (2) feet. Tama ba iyon?"" This issue has been reported to a Radio Station and clarified that the Contractor is following the design and plan to ensure that the bridge is earthquake-resistant. 

He is still requesting for an inspector from Central Office to check and monitor the construction project. There is also a project billboard in the concerned area but he also wants to know the full disclosure of the total amount spent by this time and have it posted on both sides of the bridge.

PAHATI Construction) In connection with the on-going implementation of the above-subject Project, we would like to bring to your attention the following issues/concerns/complaints in behalf of our community in Camella Homes 5: 1.0 Along the 200-m stretch of Naga Road (from entrance of Dna Julita Subd to the bridge site) which has been dug and installed with new drainage pipes and manholes by R. PAHATI CONSTRUCTION, there is no regular Traffic Management Officer assigned to manage and direct the daily flow of traffic. Likewise, the installed safety barricades/provisions are dangerously inadequate so much so that said stretch of road construction is virtually \xe2\x80\x9can accident waiting to happen\xe2\x80\x9d. 2.0 Inadequate installation of visible and informative road signage along Naga Road and in nearby affected roads. Such signs should clearly inform all commuters/affected stakeholders where to enter or pass and if possible, the time/day/period where such restrictions will be in effect; 3.0 Contractor\xe2\x80\x99s negligent work practices in breaking road pavement and excavating the roadway where the drains will be installed has resulted to at least three incidents of Maynilad Water supply mains being busted; 4.0 Information, Education and Communication (IEC) efforts to inform residents of Camella Homes 5 HOA, Dna Paz HOA, Dna Julita HOA, and nearby HOA/communities of the impacts to traffic and pedestrian/vehicle access of the construction activities related to the Project should be extended to all HOA around or near the project site. A public briefing for affected communities could be made soonest at a venue near the project site like in Camella Homes 5 or Vergon Ville covered gym for this matter. (OVER) 5.0 Contractor\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect installation of drainage mains in at least 2 locations (actually observed along Naga Road in front of Camella 5 subdivision) where the existing Maynilad Water supply main line was made to directly intersect and pierce through the concrete drain pipe instead of the Maynilad Water line passing under or over the drainage pipe. This practice is blatant violation of best engineering practice and construction standards. 6.0 The wrong construction method for installation of drainage pipe that allows Maynilad Water supply main to ""pierce"" the concrete pipe - a violation of construction specs & methods for utilities. It is kindly requested that your soonest attention and appropriate measures be effected to resolve issues and problems that persists in the project site. Truly yours, By: ARNOLD P.

Ms. Santos, retired UN officer, is complaining a certain Mr. ""Tonton"" Lim Miguel, driver of Brown Suzuki (car model failed to provide) with plate number AOA 6519 because of alleged misbehavior/malfeasance. At 4:30PM , December 12, 2015 (Saturday) Mr. Miguel allegedly harassed Ms.Santos because of the parking space in front of her house.

""Gusto niyang magpark sa harap ng bahay ko. Siya mismo yung kumatok pinto ko at tinanong kung kanino yung mga halaman. Pinagsisispa nya yung halaman ko. Ang sabi pa nya wala daw kaming karapatan na maglagay ng mga halaman sa front side ng bahay. Ang sabi ko may clearance naman kami galing sa (Manila) City Hall. May authority daw itong si Miguel na magpaalis ng nakaharang na barikada ng halaman dahil taga- DPWH sya. Napakaarogante nya at nakainom pa sya."" she stated. 

She decided to report a complaint directly to DPWH than to their barangay. 

Ms. Santos added that Mr. Miguel is from DPWH- NCR but she doubts if it's really true. As per caller, he is just a driver of a undersecretary or assistant secretary of DPWH and currently living with his relative,Tessie Agustin Agcaoilli, at 1669 Laonglaan St. Sampaloc Manila.

She requested to conduct an investigation to verify if Mr. Miguel is a DPWH employee.

The Secretary Department of Public Works and Highways

Dear Sir: This letter concerns a matter of extreme urgency. I am writing to ask your office to look into the project of Congressman Dan Fernandez of the First District of Laguna (who is also planning to run for the position of Mayor of the City of Santa Rosa, Laguna)and to put a halt to it until further investigations and safety checks have been carried out. Mr. Fernandez has embarked on a project to construct a concrete wall on the south riverbank of the Silang-Santa Rosa River, which puts the residents on the riverside at risk of severe flooding and potential collapse and destruction of their houses. This project was planned without consultation with the residents of this city, and construction has been going on for the last month. It was temporarily halted when the river flooded and overflowed on December 19, 2015, and the scaffolding that had already been built for the construction of the wall collapsed and was damaged. Work on the project resumed last week. From the construction workers\' remarks and seeing the current scaffolding, the height of this planned wall will be higher than the height of the original south riverbank: this, in effect, cuts the width of the river by at least 30% and narrows it considerably. In the event of heavy rain or another typhoon, the volume of water that gets dumped into this river becomes enormous. With the width of the river reduced by 1/3 following construction of the south riverbank concrete wall, the potential for this project to make matters worse has been more than compounded. In the light of the severe flooding throughout the city that happened most recently when the river overflowed above the south riverbank on December 19, 2015,we can foresee that this project will cause the water level to rise above the original riverbank\xe2\x80\x99s height and lead to foreseeable damage and destruction of the homes bordering the north riverbank, and flooding of the roads, especially Gov. Feliciano Gomez St (which parallels the river) and Arambulo and Anonuevo streets (which are perpendicular to Gov. F. Gomez Street). When the flood water level in the river rises above the riverbank and batters the walls of the homes built along the north riverbank, these houses walls will eventually collapse. In our case, the bedroom where my bedridden parents lodge (aged 89 years and 93 years, and incapacitated by multiple strokes) is located right beside the riverbank on the north side. If the floodwaters rise, the water will overflow above the window of their bedroom and flood the bedroom. Evacuating them to a safer place in time of this foreseeable emergency is going to prove to be a challenge for their 2 caregivers. We foresee that the whole house will be inundated with floodwaters following completion of this concrete wall on the opposite side of the river. Our house is sturdily built and has stood on the same site since 1966. Our grandmother\'s ancestral house was built by our grandfather in 1935 and has withstood 8 decades of typhoons without suffering any damage. They are at high risk of being destroyed as a consequence of Mr. Fernandez\'s inadequately researched public project. The other homes along the riverbank which lie west and east of our parents\' and grandparents\' homes are constructed of more flimsy materials and are much smaller, and bound to take a much harder hit and be more easily damaged or destroyed. Mr. Fernandez newly constructed ""house""/campaign headquarters lies on the other side of Gov. Feliciano Gomez Street further east, and is constructed on higher ground with high concrete walls, and is unlikely to be at risk of flooding, unlike ours and our neighbors\' houses. While the reasoning behind this project may have been well-meaning and well-intentioned, the fact remains that this project has been undertaken without the necessary engineering assessments (or maybe, or with utter disregard for them). Construction is currently continuing. There have not been any public announcements nor discussion regarding this project, and no attempt to liaise and inform the residents of the extent and potential consequences of this project have been made. Because of the imminent danger and considerable damage to person and property it threatens to bring, we are therefore asking you to look into this matter urgently and halt construction until a public forum and investigation have been carried out. 

Very truly yours, 

Dr. Melissa Jeanne P. Batilando 
Engr. Emiliano Joel P. Batilando, Jr.

"CFMC-20160074","Hi \xe2\x80\x93 As a backgrounder, I am a resident of Matungao, Bulakan, Bulacan. I am emailing not to instigate an argument or anything but to inform you that we are severely affected by the road repair project that you started in our area.  I am saying it severely since the project does not only took few weeks but almost more than a year already of heavy traffic, long walks of our children when going to school, dirt it caused in the area that are almost hazardous when commuting and so much more even in little things that makes your day in a bad mood. In addition, what annoys the people here is that the work of the project stopped from time to time causing delays due to changing of contractors which we heard due to budget issues.
My apologies if this mail was sent to all email address I found on your site since I am not sure who is the right person to approach but I found courage to do so when your contractor blocked the street corner going to our houses on which no means of transportation can enter and knowing today that it was stopped because there is no budget to continue the task. I know we need to sacrifice to make things better but knowing the situation, i think it is not fair to the people affected.
I believed we are all professionals here and starting a project means that it has an estimated time of completion. May we know when the ETC of the road project on our area is?'","2016-01-19 09:55:15","4","7"

Almost all roads in the country had been widened and repaired/replaced, but this stretch seem to have been neglected or avoided. Is there a strong reason why? Many of us motorists, upon exiting Pura from TPLEX have suffered accidents due to very very bad road- severely broken slabs, potholes as big as a meter, and even more, this is the exit point and entry point toward the TPLEX. We hope that something can be done before you leave your post.

Malugod po naming ipinararating sa inyong kaalaman ang aming reklamo laban kay Gng. Salve R. Mira sa maraming dahilan:

1. Sa kanyang pahintulot na magtayo ng tindahan ang mga tao na may kapalit na halaga. Ang lugar na ito ay sakop pa ng Right of Way ng DPWH Road Widening project ditto sa Purok 2, Marcos Highway, Sampaloc, Tanay, Rizal.

2. Napaka delikado po ang lugar na ito dahil gilid po ito ng creek at ilang beses nang natibag ang riprap dito sa paghukay nila ng lupa at pagputol ng puno.

3. Bumara ang mga bato sa ilog dahilan ng pagtaas ng tubig sa ilog na halos umabot na sa bubong ng ibang bahay noong bagyong Undoy.

4. Walang habas na pagkalkal ng lupa sa gilid ng kalsada dahil pinapatag nila sa ibaba. Nagmumukhang bangin na po ang gilid ng highway. Pagdating ng tag-ulan, tibag na ulit ang panibagong rip-rap. Sayang po ang pondo ng gobyerno na dapat mapunta sa ibang mahalagang proyekto.

5. Ang kanilang dumi sa bahay ay deretso sa ilog kaya umaalingasaw ang masamang amoy lalo na kung mayroon man lubhang napakaliit at mababaw dahilan ng pagawas ng dumi. Huwag na po nating hayaan na mangyari pa and di inaasahang sakuna sa darating na panahon.

6. At kami po ay nagkakaisang lumagda. Sana dinggin ang aming simpleng hinaing sa kapakanan ng napakarami at hindi sa interes ng isang tao.

"CFMC-20160145","PAKI TINGNAN NANMAN ANG PROJECT NAITO PARA MATAPOS NA ANG KALBARYO SA TRAPIK DITO SA AMIN. SALAMAT PO. Halos isang linggo matapos ilathala ng Angono Rizal News Online (aRNO) ang dalawang taon nang nabibinbin na tulay sa Darangan, personal na pinuntahan ng aRNO kaninang Huwebes ng umaga, January 21, ang munisipyo ng Binangonan upang kunin ang update, ang kanilang pahayag, at para sa patas na pag-uulat ukol sa developing story na ito. Partikular na pinuntahan ng aRNO ang Engineering Department pero wala umano ang otorisadong magsalita ukol dito. Hindi rin pinapasok ang aRNO sa nasabing opisina pero may dalawang staff dito ang kumausap sa aRNO sa lobby. Humingi ng pahintulot ang aRNO sa babae at lalaki na staff para makuha ang kanilang pangalan para sa ulat na ito, pero tumanggi sila. Ayon sa dalawang staff, maging ang Pamahalaang Bayan ng Binangonan ay nababahala sa mabagal na paggawa sa tulay na proyekto ng DPWH Region IV-A. Ayon pa sa nakausap ng aRNO, ang dahilan kung bakit hindi pa rin natatapos ang tulay ay dahil sa hindi pa rin umano natatapos ng Manila Water na ayusin ang mga tubo at daluyan ng tubig na maaapektuhan sa paggawa ng tulay. \xe2\x80\x9cMasikip din kasi yung lugar kaya hindi nagkakasya ang mga malalaking equipment na kailangan para sa paggawa ng tulay,\xe2\x80\x9d wika ng nakausap ng aRNO. Ang paliwanag ng dalawang staff ay halos katulad din ng comment ng isang mambabasa ng aRNO sa nasabing isyu. \xe2\x80\x9cTinanong ko yung kaibigan ko sa DPWH (kung) ano nangyari dyan sa tulay. Delay daw yan kasi bukod sa pinakamasikip na tulay daw yan sa Binangonan na part ng widening project eh ang tagal umaksyon ng PLDT MERALCO at Manila Waters. Hirap daw heavy equipment dyan kasi nakadikit sa residential at commercial building pero tentative date daw ng tapos nyan eh sa February or March. Naka-fabricate na yung part na ikakabit daw dyan,\xe2\x80\x9d wika ni aRNO reader Edmund Dantes. Nang tanungin din ang staff sa nasabing opisina kung matatapos ngayong taon ang tulay, hindi naman ito tiyak na nasagot ng kausap ng aRNO dahil depende nga ito sa ikikilos ng Manila Water at DPWH Region IV-A. Samantala, sa Martes ay pupunta ang aRNO sa DPWH Region IV-A sa opisina nito sa Quezon City upang kuhanan sila ng update at pahayag.'","2016-02-04 10:16:19","5","16"

We all know that, when computing or planning for a project, you already put into factor the weather conditions. Philippines experience at least 10 typhoons a year and numerous heavy rains brought about by either monsoon rains or la nina phenomenon. Educated engineers will know this! And yet, Engr Saliganan made this as a pathetic excuse of not meeting his deadline. As we know, when a deadline is not met, it is wasting valuable resources and eventually wasting taxpayer\'s money! The past months have not been really that wet compared to past years. The rain has been minimal to impact a really well planned and well executed projects. This doesn\'t seem to be one. I request that a spot check by DPWH Manila inspectors be conducted to ensure these projects have not been compromised and taxpayers\' money had not been unnecessarily wasted. The concreting of these National project is still allegedly ""ongoing"" and yet we have noticed very few movements of equipments for such projects. Of a grave concern too, is the seemingly substandard quality of concreting of these projects. You can not travel more than 4 kilometres of these \'new\' cemented roads without experiencing big cracks and chips on them! Seriously! I urge your good office to please send a Qualified Honest Inspector to spot check these projects before it\'s too late. Hoping for your positive and quick response. Regards, Tino Nonoy San Jose, Baggao, Cagayan.

"CFMC-20160200","ROADS/ROADS SAFETY

As per our phone conversation i am reporting/complaining the DPWH project along Arnaiz Avenue in Makati between Evangelista and Edison Streets due to reasons below:

This project is causing heavy traffic due to heavy equipment parked on the road like backhoe, dump truck, pison, they also put their barracks on the road and their materials like sand & gravel.

They are not doing anything for more than 2 weeks now due to broken back hoe.  If they do, they are working even during the wee hours of the night when everybody is sleeping.  

Some portions are already finished and can be open to travellers but they keep it closed for unknown reason.

Safety is not evident as they leave their contuctions materials scattered around the area, they just leave open excavated area in which i think is the most hazardous contuction operations.   
I will send you the pictures later tonight or tomorrow morning.
I hope you could do something about this.

Thank you so much.

"CFMC-20160280","I would like to share a few pics of my street currently under ""renovations"" for the past 3 weeks. As you can see the street has been completely stripped and LEFT uncemented for the past 2 weeks. This is unacceptable. We have a PWD and unfortunately we cannot get our car inside the drive way due to these ""renovations"". We have to park our car on the otherside of the street and help the carry PWD cross the uncemented road. I have not seen any construction workers for the past 5 days and no signs of them coming back. Another problem is the man holes left by the DPWH. As you can see by the pictures they have been left uncovered, the concern here is that one of these days someone will fall into one and hoping that it is not a child (which already happened last year when they renovated the other side of the street) .

Our complaint is that these unfinished road sections has been causing tremendous traffic since late last year up to now, especially during rush hour because the widened road seems to have reverted to a one-lane two-way traffic upon reaching these places. What irritates most motorists is that these portions are practically the busiest portions of the urban area part of the national highway in Puerto Princesa City, if not for the entire Province of Palawan. The contractor left these unfinished portions idle and untouched for several months already, proceeding its concreting of the road shoulders instead to the outskirts of the city (rural part).

May I respectfully bring to your attention (please see attached photos I have just taken today) the unfinished road shoulder and intersection concreting by DPWH Palawan 3rd Engineering District (I  heard it was contracted to Lustre Construction), which has been left idle and unfinished for several months already (the portion being complained has been in this condition before Christmas of 2015). This causes terrible traffic as the road seems to have reverted to a one-lane,two-way traffic because of the unfinished works.  I  has is also a traffic hazard.

There no signs of attention from DPWH. So I feel that no information was being given by the local officials since most of them are if not truckers owns busses. They may be afraid of having to detour which may cause them additional opex.

I'd like to ask, is it legal to close the whole street... like not passable to all vehicles. Should it be like only one lane is closed? Or close only to passerby but the residents in the street have access to the roads. What if an emergency happened? Please enlightened me. Thanks.""","2016-05-02 11:12:42","4","6"

An Open Letter to DPWH
Dear DPWH,
We the residents and people of the Municipalities of Bugallon Pangasinan, Aguilar Pangasinan, Mangatarem, Pangasinan and other Municipalities that are benefited of the use of the PADILLA BRIDGE located in Barangay Ba\xc3\xb1aga,Bugallon,Pangasinan (which connects the Municipality of Bugallon To Lingayen,Pangasinan )are so greatful for the renovation of the said bridge and the road widening along the roads to Ease the traffic and make our travel comfortable.It has almost been a year already since the bridge was closed and place into reconstruction. It had a target completion but it was moved yet we understand that there maybe complexities that the contractor and government is going through and still we waited patiently.But our dilemma right now is that its been months already since the completion was moved and that the project was in no progress. We The Students,workers and travelers are already suffering from the rerouting which add up minutes if not hours to our travel time, instead of spending it with our families and our studies or work if not rest,not to mention the increase in the fare and fuel which could have been used to other important things. I know all things are due to process but we hope that the project be not delayed anymore and that the historical value of the bridge be sustained. We hope that the project may be done already, the steel bars are already laid into place and waiting,concrete is the only thing needed to be poured for it to be finished that it will be back to its functionality. And not to mention the more the delay the more the money of the people is spent.Hence, we know there is still ripening/maturing time for the concrete. So may we sincerely ask your Honorable office to do an action that the Project be not be delayed anymore for the monsoon/rainy months are coming and it will not be an ache to all of us to travel around due to the rerouting, and that our parents,husband/wife,Family,Co-workers,friends etc. won't be worried about our safety and travel time anymore.
Thank you And God speed!
Sincerely,
Your Boss
The Residents of Pangasinan
The People of the Philippines""","2016-05-02 11:13:43","5","7"

Several accidents have already happened in the past few weeks along these said barriers and as of today (April 27, 2016) another accident took place infront of the Iglesia ni Cristo - New Era University where a truck headed northward to Angeles City rampaged the concrete barrier and crossing head-on the opposite lane.(Pls see attached pictures) This is not the first time that such accident happened in this particular area.

Magandang araw!

Ako po'y obrero na ang misis e taga-Francisco Homes dito sa San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. Nakakagigil na itong walang silbing tulay sa boundary ng city naming at ng Caloocan City (Sampaguita tawag dun sa mismong lugar).

Mahigit isang taon kaming nagdusa sa trapik noong ginawa ang tulay ng Alat San Jose Bridge pero hanggang ngayon hindi naman 'to nadadaanan gawa ng me mga bahay pa sa kabilang dulo nung tulay.

Sabi ng traffic enforcer naming, sa side daw 'yun ng Caloocan. Hindi pa raw kasi nare-relocate. Kaya daw kahit hindi nila sakop 'yung kabila, tinatauhan nila ng nagta-trapik dahil kung hindi, lagging mapeperwisyo mga taga-San Jose.

Sino ba talaga dapt kumilos dito't bakit hanggang ngayon e 'di magamit ang tulay? Laking luwag sana neto sa'min. Mag-aapat o limang taon na yatang gawa 'yang tulay na 'yan ah! Malaking perwisyo sa'min talaga! Kung kelan pa lumapad at tumibay (hindi na taun-taon nasisira) mga kalsada naming sa San Jose, eto naman ang dusa naming tuwing e-exit pa-Caloocan o luluwas pa-Maynila.

"CFMC-20160490","Dearest Secretary Singson, Shalom ! I am a regular biyahero from Manila to Ifugao and vise versa every week as I am working in Manila. Sad to report as a concern citizen that the usual travel of 9 hours from Manila to Ifugao is taking us now almost 18 to 22 hours just because of a very simple re-blocking project of the DPWH from Sta Fe to San Jose. Many Foreigners and some local tourists including me from Banaue and Sagada who missed their international and local flights were so angry because no one from the ground even the policemen passing cannot provide information what is happening with the traffic menace. Drivers from either lane to manila and to the north to Viscaya, Quirino, Isabela, Cagayan, Aparri, Kalinga, Mountain Province and Ifugao are shouting to the foreigners IT IS MORE FUN IN THE PHILIPPINES. MABUHAY ANG DAANG MATUWID!!! With these remarks of disgust from the public, I was so ashamed as a Civil Engineer like you are and this prompted me to search for the DPWH grievance redress mechanism hotline from your website but found your email ad. This are my concerns: i) the traffic everyday at that section if not given attention immediately is next to economic sabotage. The cost of missed flights, office hours, goods undelivered is already enormous than the cost of a very simple re-blocking that did not consider traffic management and its repercussion at all by the contractor and an insensitive regional or district DPWH offices. Imagine, some are already sacrificing to use the Ambuklao road via Baguio just to go to manila because of the mismanagement of the re-blocking that is taking too long. ii) Daang Matuwid and your Unquestionable Integrity and Performance Hon. Singson that regain the respect for DPWH will go down the drain just because of what is now happening to Dalton Pass. iii) Many voters will be disenfranchise for those who will be leaving manila to the provinces and from the provinces to Manila on the night of May 8,2016 because by then they will only arrive home about 6PM of May 9,2016 as what we are experiencing since the latest re-blocking project started. (actual experience today May 1-2,2016 left banaue ifugao at 7 pm on Sunday, reach aritao at 10pm and stranded sta fe until 8Am of Monday and reach manila 6PM of Monday) Suggestions: i) there are several single PCCP blocks that were removed and replaced and are causing one way traffic, can we design this for a 3-7 days concrete and cover these with metal flat sheets so that it can be opened to traffic right away. Further, the shoulder could be widened and improved temporarily as detour. ii) For several short span bridges (about 5) undergoing retrofitting: Why are they not constructed simultaneously and immediately after the steel bars and form works are placed. Again, these can be provided with bypass over the prepared section and or inclusion of detour. For instance, I saw one bridge is finished and what was remaining is the approach connection only but was left undone and it causes one way traffic for several days already, why? Another bridge with in-placed steel bars but not poured. This will go viral in social media am sure in the next few days if no improvement will be made to reduce the inconveniences of the riding public. I would be happy to receive any respond from those staff managing the secretary's affair. Very Truly Yours, Engr. Ericson Mammag""","2016-05-06 11:08:59","4","7"

"CFMC-20160514","The Honorable Secretary
Department of Public Works and Highways
Port Area
Manila

Sir:

I accidentally came into possession of a leaflet with an inscription as: Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s Corner: Let us know what you think: - this leaflet encouraged and emboldened me to write this letter.
My concern is about the Road Widening Project that your Department is presently implementing and constructing at the Capital town of Virac, province of Catanduanes.
Primordially, I am personally pleased by this project because it serves, among others as a timely solution to an increasing vehicular and pedestrian traffic, now experienced in this town. Please note that the road, upon which your project is going on, traverses the area where usually populated establishments are to be found, such as, the Provincial Hospital, the Airport and Catanduanes State University to name some.
The main intention of this letter is to call the attention and bring to the knowledge of your good office and person the many shortcomings or defects in the construction of the above-mentioned project which I have personally noticed and observed in my capacity as a non-engineer person. Such observations are the following:
The Road-widening project includes the construction of a drainage system in the form of a line-canal underneath the concrete pavement. However, the drainage system, part of the widening works is so constructed that it avoids as it swerves away from private structures built along the right-of-way portion of the area traversed by the drainage system. As a result, the finished portion of the project appear zigzagging. This observation is best manifested in the following private structures found setting outright on the area of right of way of the project to wit:
1. Portion fronting Funenaria Bugtong \xe2\x80\x93 the drainage was made to swerve away from the establishment as it passes in front of the funeral parlor. Reports however has it that in the construction of the building of said funeral house, its owner was made to sign a waiver that he is to remove the structure when the government should need the area.
2. Portions of the total length of the drainage system were constructed inside concrete fences of some residential houses but it left behind the fences untouched negating the very purpose of the project which is to widen the National Road.
Recently, however, said fences were now removed but leaving behind fences belonging to former Governor Leandro Verceles Jr. and one belonging to a certain Segundo Gianan, both of whom are influential family in this province. As a result, the project is a picture of zigzag pathway alongside the more or less straight national road.
3. Portion of the Project near and horizontal to the concrete fence of the airport is now completed, but the work left behind a hilly or a protruding concrete pavement not visible from a distance. The uneven pavement makes that portion of the national road hazardous.
4. Before the construction of present drainage system, there was already an existing open line canal in front of the airport runway. This line canal cater to the floodwaters naturally flowing from the runway through holes at the foot of the concrete fence saving the national road from flooding.
Present construction works discarded the old open canal and constructed in its instead a closed drainage system. Consequently, depriving floodwaters its natural flow from the runway to the drainage system. As a result, the highway floods when it rains, which was not the case with the old open canal system.
5. At the junction of the national road and Moonwalk road, a provincial road, there is an existing lateral drainage system that directs the flow of waters to the open line canal along Moonwalk road. The construction work of the new drainage system disregarded the simple fact that the old lateral drainage system is too narrow in width to accommodate the increased volume of floodwaters that flow under the expanded drainage system of subject project.
6. Also, because of the No. 5 circumstance, the bulk of the floodwaters will flow directly to the low grounds where the Provincial Hospital and many residential houses are located. This may lead to floodings in said area. It must be noted that the purpose of the lateral drainage canal was to redirect the flow of floodwaters to the open line canal along Moonwalk Road where existing drainage system could accommodate larger volume of floodwaters. Again, this simple engineering factor was evidently ignored.

In view of the foregoing, we respectfully request your good office to conduct a thorough investigation so as to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings in the implementation and construction of the subject Road Widening Project.
  
Respectfully Yours,'","2016-05-17 12:46:41","4","6"

Ang masaklap po nito ang di po na semento ay yong kritikal na bahagi na palusong.
Tinapos ang sidewalk at canal pero ang kalye ay nanatiling bako-bako at madulas dahil wala na daw pondo.
Dipo ba pag nagplano tayo ay titignan natin yong kritikal na bahagi upang ito ay maging prioridad?
Kaso ito po ang naiwan.
Binabaha po ang mababang bahagi sa konting ulan pa pa lamang dahil yong tubig sa mataas na bahagi ay dito nag-iipon.
Papano na lang kung umiral na ang hanging habagat? o bagyo kaya?
SANA PO AY MAPONDOHAN ITO AT MATAPOS NA.

Dear Madam:

This refers to your letter, dated 18 April 2016, regarding the request of Vice-Mayor Mamerta P. Milo Hubo of San Agustin, Surigao del Sur in the DPWH's matrix of pending referrals that was forwarded to your Office. The request was actually not referred to the DPWH but to the Department of Agriculture and National Irrigation Administration. We are glad that the concern was pleasantly clarified with Mr. Nestor E. Presto, DPWH's Liaison Officer, during the 4th Citizens' Feedback Liaison Officers' meeting on 20 April 2016.

Thank you and best regards.


Very truly yours,

"CFMC-20160526","Good pm. Mag report lang po ako regarding sa road construction dito sa area namin sa Brgy Tatalon Araneta Ave Qc. Bali nAg start po yung repair before December last year and until now hindi pa din po sila natatapos kahit dito man lang sa mismong street namin (Kaliraya). Hindi naman po sa minamadali kaso napapansin na din po ng mga tao dito na sobrang bagal ng mga gumagawa. Madalas e makikita mo silang nakatambay at nagke-kwentuhan. Kapansin-pansin po talaga ang kanilang kabagalan. Ang sasakyan po namin hindi na namin maiuwi since last year dahil sa road construction na ginagawa nila. Yung ibang mga nasementong kalsada pa po ay pachi-pachi ang gawa parang chessboard. May mga parte pa ng kalsada na hindi pa nasesementuhan. At dahil nag-uulan na nitong mga nakaraang araw, naiipunan ito ng tubig at nagdudulot ng baha. At nung nakaraan nga ay may nahulog na matandang babae dahil marupok ang ginawa nilang tulay na kahoy. Itinawag ko na din po ito sa inyong hotline at sinabi na isend ko din sa fb page ninyo para maipost ko ang mga picture. 

Eto pong picture na ito ay intersection. Kung mapapansin ninyo ay halos hindi sya madaanan ng mga sasakyan. Yung isang side na galing at papuntang Elga street lang ang makakadaan.

Eto naman yung part na hindi pa nasesementuhan. Puno na ng tubig dahil sa ulan at hindi man lang ginawan ng daluyan ng tubig.

Eto yung isa lang parte na walang semento

Eto naman yung binuhusan nila ng semento pero nasira yung plywood na umaalalay sa ilalim. Hindi ko maintindihan kung dapat ba talagang may plywood since sesementuhan naman sya. Tatlong araw na nilang pinupukpok ng martilyo at pako yang semento. Kung mapapansin nyo ang dami nila nakapwesto dyan pero lamang ang kwentuhan nila

Sana po ay maaksyunan nyo ito. Alam ko na hindi ganun kabilis gumawa ng kalsada pero hindi naman po siguro kailangan abutin ng ilang bwan para magawa nila ng maayos yung kalye namin. Maraming salamat po.

Address: Dasmari\xc3\xb1as City, Cavite
Contact details: yta81859@yahoo.com / 0922-893-9353

This is Mrs. Yolanda Alvarado, a resident from Dasmari\xc3\xb1as City, Cavite. Ang concern ko ay tungkol sa isang project along Brgy. Luzviminda II, Area F, Dasmari\xc3\xb1as City, Cavite specifically in front of Bahay Pangarap Subdivision. A road project was started here recently near a creek. Before na gawin ang project na \xe2\x80\x98yon, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem kasi hindi naman nag o-overflow ang creek. Noong ginagawa ang kalsada, nagkaroon ng tambak in both sides of the road which blocked the water na makapunta sa creek. Then, recently noong umulan\xe2\x80\x94 about two days ago\xe2\x80\x94 nagulat kami kasi biglang bumaha sa mga bahay ng residents doon. Never na bumaha ng ganoong katindi doon. Dati, kapag naulan, manageable ang situation. Pero nitong nakaraan, konting ulan lang ganon na agad kalala ang sitwasyon. Pumasok sa mga bahay ang napakaruming tubig at mga basura. Worst is hanggang baywang ang baha! First time talaga na nag-overflow ang creek at pumunta sa mga bahay ang tubig. Affected ang mga business ng local residents at may unexpected damages sa mga bahay. Yesterday, I talked to a man namely Damaso Constantino to address my concern. I\xe2\x80\x99am not sure if he\xe2\x80\x99s an engineer but I think he is. Tinanong ko kung sino ang may handle ng project pero sabi n\xe2\x80\x99ya di raw sa DPWH, sa Sub-district engineering daw. Gusto ko lang iparating ang reklamo ko dahil parang wala naman silang ginagawa sa after effect ng project. Yes, nakumpleto ang road project at guminhawa ang mga jeepney driver pero papatayin naman nila ang mga residente. Napaka-delikado lalo na sa mga bata na naglalaro malapit sa creek. I suggest immediate action regarding my concern. Please have an inspection here to know the exact situation at ang after effect ng ginawang road project dito. Dati, hindi nangyayari yang mga \xe2\x80\x98yan. Pero about two days pa lang after project completion, ganyan agad ang effect sa ulan. Paano pa kapag bagyo na?  Madalas na umulan ngayon at pag hindi nasolusyunan, delikado para sa mga residente. Nakakatakot ang bulwak ng tubig talagang delikado. Please have an immediate response regarding my concern. Thank you.'","2016-05-24 09:02:19","4","6"

"CFMC-20160552","I am a resident of Talayan Village. I see that construction of EEI for the Skyway Stage 3 is ongoing and in full swing along Araneta Ave. I would like to know what you plan to do about flood control as flood level in our area is really really bad. A number of people died during Ondoy (2009) and Habagat (2012/2013) and this is not a light matter, not a joking matter at all. We are located in one of the more elevated areas in the village but the water level during Ondoy was up to the roof. Our family driver drowned (and died). We lost our home (we were not able to live in it after Ondoy). I cannot explain it enough. Because of your construction the 'normal' water level in Araneta creek has risen. I have been a resident of Talayan Village since the 80s. Please, we beg you, not to worsen the flood situation. Hold off construction until you alleviate flood concerns, widening of waterways, etc. I looked it up and this project is worth 20+ billion pesos. I don't think it is too much to ask to include the safety of the people that will be affected by your construction. The hassle and dirt of your construction we could live with as long as your project will not aggravate the flood situation. Whenever it rains, I almost can't sleep because of worry. Please do not aggravate the situation we have to live with. Although as I stated earlier, you already have. Just one 'poste' built along Araneta Avenue between Maria Clara and Quezon Ave and the water level of Araneta Creek already rose. How many more 'postes' are you going to build?!?!?! I am really scared. Your response will be greatly appreciated. I hope to receive concrete answers not just vague, sweeping statements of assurance that will in no way alleviate our concerns.

If it is, then why in the second district of Leyte Engineering District painted with broken lines the center of the road instead on the lines next to the center especially on areas where roads were already widened with four lanes? I know the project was not yet finished but I guess it is a waste of money to buy paint to be marked on the wrong side of the road?

"CFMC-20160565","Hi! I just would like to complaint about 2 things, first is the regarding the lights along the EDSA-Ayala Tunnel and same with EDSA-Shaw tunnel. I have noticed that ever since the EDSA-Ayala tunnel was completed, it did not have sufficient lighting inside the tunnel. Same goes with the EDSA-Shaw tunnel, which according to MMDA lights are only turned on during night time. We all know that road safety is everyone's top priority. But in this case I don't think we are putting it on top of our list. Tunnels are really dark in reality, daylight will be very impossible to enter it. That's why we need to install ample lights inside. Motorists should be able to have clear vision inside the tunnel. And should not be required to open their respective head and tail lights. Please install ample lighting in both tunnels since it has been dark for a long time already. For the safety of the motorists passing the tunnel everyday. Secondly, I have noticed that the Philippines has no standard traffic law or traffic signs being used. Why can't we have just one standard law that can be easily understood by the motorist. So everyone is guided by that law. Signages play an important role in the countries traffic system. If we have uniformity in our signages, motorist can easily identify the road rules and regulations. Local Government should follow DPWH laws and not have their own. This adds to the confusion of the motorist. If we have different ordinances in every city. All of us should just use and follow one system. Let me know how I can be of help in solving the long problem of our country. And that is our traffic system. You may contact me thru my mobile phone or e-mail. Thanks and hope to hera from you soon!""","2016-05-31 13:38:29","4","8"
