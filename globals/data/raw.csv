I was asked to follow-up on the status of a billing collection and to comply should there be any other requirements needed for it to be approved. In which I did what I was asked to do and everything went fine. In fact, all the people together with the Section/Unit Heads that I inter-acted with were very courteous and accommodating. And I so much admired the working attitude with the most of them. After all its supporting papers were checked by the ICU officer, the folder/voucher I was tasked to follow-up was forwarded to the Accounting Section. And there, they asked for another requirement wherein I also complied. It is just so happen that the original document will be coming from Manila and so an advanced copy were faxed as the original will be sent via parcel delivery. Sir, I would like to ask for your attention in reviewing the performance of Ms. Evangaline C. Manalo, Accountant III. She is the Head of the Accounting Unit here in DPWH xe2x80x93 5th LED. Among all the officers and staff working in this noble institution, Ms. Manalo is the exact opposite of them all. It is so easy for her to curse at any person whom she finds lower than her position in office. I was one of those lowly people she has raised her voice with as she pointed her finger towards me, scolding me, accusing me and saying so many things that were not part of my purpose of being there. I tried to talk and ask around with other people whom like me, being a Liaison Officer, processes billing collections from licensed contractors with regards to what they can comment about Ms. Evangeline Manalo and we all shared common observations and experiences about her, among them were: - Very unaccommodating - Tactless, curses at people naming them with very unpleasant words - Humiliates other people with rude and degrading remarks - Always frowning and very unfriendly - Unprofessional with her actions as well as with her words - Capricious and very fickle minded - Uncooperative and very difficult to approach Even the people working in DPWH 5th LED can also attest that Ms. Manalo is the most difficult person to work with. I pray that you would give ample attention on this matter sir. And if it is possible, I would greatly appreciate it if my name would be held with discretion when you consider and look into her work ethics. Thank you so much, God Bless and more power to you.

The legacy u can leave the DPWH is giving back the confidence of people in the agency. But the efforts we have exerted so far has only lasting effect. the fact that there are officers, middle managers that are very protective of their wards despite the misdemeanor they do is an indication that the straight path we advocate is not yet inculcated in their way of life. Our respectable USEC Medenillas support of MS MARIA Antoinette PUNO, the OIC chief accountant is so evident, her incompetence notwithstanding. Her errors in judgement have caused the agency enormous troubles in terms of money and delays. We are committed to perform at least 70 percent of the agency target but at the rate We are going, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REACH IT. After the double payments were discovered we are wondering how many double payments are out there remaining to be discovered. Up to now, no recommendation or changes in the system have been installed to safeguard against double payments. All she did was pass the blame on the person who encoded the transaction. Thanks to u sir, the contractor returned the erroneous payment made after 3 months. at least because of your good screening of contractors for the agency, we have legit contractors as clients.

Ang AdminOfficer na ito ay labis na inaabuso ang kanyang kapangyarihan sa gobyerno. Ang kanyang service sa gobyerno ay ginagamit sa pansariling lakad kahit araw ng sabado at linggo. Ginagamit nya sa pamamalengke or pagggrocery. Nakaattach dito ang isang larawan na aking nakunan noong Nov 29, 2014 (sabado). Marami pang beses na nakakasulubong ko ang service na yan na gingamit nya tuwing araw ng linggo. Isa pang halimbawa ng kanyang pangaabuso ay ang pagmamanipula ng leave. Ang isang accountant III na nagngngalang Lucy Delen ay pinayagan niyang naka leave without pay sa loob ng maraming buwan (tingin ko po ay anim na buwan) kahit na ito ay nagtatrabaho na sa canada para lamang umabot ang kanyang serbisyo ng 15 years upang makuha ang kanyang mga benepisyo. Ang mabilisang pagppromote ng kanyang malapit na kamaganak (Diana Lynn Agno) sa position kahit na wala pa itong matagal na experience sa kanyang kinalagyang position.

CFMC-20150845,"  HELLO THERE HONORABLE SECRETARY  have been an avid fan of the changes that you have made in the department.  One thing that I admire most is the publics accessibility and interaction with the Department no matter how huge or small the problems is, you always see to it that all are attended accordingly, so hats off for that.  Here is the punchline, I would appreciate it so much if somebody or someone or anyone in the Department that can enlighten me in the process of promotion after the rationalization plan.  Is it still the Departments policy that when it comes to a promotion its not how you know your job but its who you know in the higher ranks.  Before I decided to put these thoughts into writing I repeatedly ask myself if it will benefit me, and my answer is no, because I am one of the casualties of war so to speak. Nevertheless, it will help clear things, recently the Department promoted an Engineer IV named Ma. Victoria Gregorio, mains office BAC office who has been separated in the service way before the rat plan, she has been working overseas for 3 or 4 years there, then after she decided to go home for good she returned in the service right after the chaos of the rat plan emerging as Project Manager.  Well, as long as I remember she did not avail of anything in the rat plan nor resigned nor file a LOA (clearly its not allowed to be on leave for that long in the government) unless she has an exemption to any other ordinary government employee.  Clearly her case is not because of loyalty with the department because there are dozens of Engineers in her rank thats been sticking their  with brains to their jobs in the dept hoping for a similar place where she is.  Anyway can anybody with authority that can explain how this happens? for the sake of what the Departments advocacy (marangal na serbisyo, tungo sa pagbabago)  More power and more answers pls.

Singson Kagawaran ng mga Pagawain at Lansangang Pambayan Port Area, Manila Mahal naming Kalihim Singson, Paki imbestigahan naman po ang harapang pagbabalewala at pagmamanipula ng mga taong nakapaligid sa inyo at sa inyong pagnanais na pagbabago sa DPWH. Marahil ay di nyo alam ang background ng taong ito na binigyan nyo ng Special Order para gawing OIC-ADE ng Pampanga 2nd Engineering District (S.O No. 75, S, 2015). Kaya heto po ang kamangha manghang tungkol sa kanya. 1. Siya po si NOMER ABEL P. CANLAS, dating radio operator ng Pampanga Sub-district Engineering Office noong District Engineer pa si USEC Rafael Yabut. Naging Administrative Officer ng Pampanga 1st District Engineering Office kapalit noon ni Ador Canlas na nooxe2x80x99y naging Assistant District Engineer sa Tarlac. 2. Napaka giliw niyang empleyado lalo na sa mga Contractors noong nasa Pampanga 1st District Engineering Office pa siya dahil siya ang nagaayos sa mga ito tuwing may bidding at nangongolekta ng SOP. 3. Nag-aral ng Civil Engineering at nag graduate noong 2013 habang siya ang Administrative Officer ng Pampanga 1st District Office ng hindi man lang nag file ng leave of absence kahit minsan. Ito ay sa panahon ni yumaong D.E. Jose Datu at sinundan ni D.E. Enrico Guilas. Sana ay imbestigahan naman ng Civil Service Commission ang Leave Card nitong taong ito. 4. Kumuha ng C.E. board examination pagka graduate ng hindi man lang nagreview pero pumasa. Dahil sa pagbabayad ng P150,000.00. Kaya po isa siya sa mga produkto ng xe2x80x9cR.A. 150xe2x80x9d kung tawagin namin dito sa Pampanga dahil hindi naman sila karapatdapat na gawaran ng R.A 1080. 5. Nag test sa Promotional Exam noong 2014 pero marahil dahil di puedeng bayaran ang CSC ay hindi pumasa. Subalit na promote parin bilang Engr. IV sa UPMO, mula sa pagiging administrative officer, sa tulong syempre ni USEC at ni Kuyang USEC, ito ay loob ng wala pang isang (1) taon mula ng siya ay nag graduate sa Republic Central Colleges. Mukhang naisahan na naman po ang inyong patakaran. Ang gagaling po nila diba? 6. Matagal na po naming naririnig dito sa Region III ang plano nila USEC at Kuyang Usec na gagawin siyang District Engineer Kapalit ni OIC-DE Juanito Reguyal na magreretiro sa Agusto, at heto na nga po ang kanilang unang hakbang, napa pirma nila ang isang Special Order na ginagawa siyang OIC-ADE. Puede po ba iyon kahit di nya naipasa ang promotional exam?. Hindi po ba pagmamanipula na naman iyon sa mga polisiya ninyo tungo sa pagbabagong anyo ng DPWH? Paki aksyunan naman po agad ito at baka gawan nila ng paraan na gawin siyang Regional Director. Magiging kaawa-awa na naman ang DPWH pag nagkataon dahil halata naman na wala siyang kaalaman sa Civil Engineering profession dahil puro pagkakaperahan lamang ang laman ng kanyang isip. Kayo lamang po ang makakapigil sa pamamayagpag ng taong ito at ng kanyang mga Kuyang na sana po ay ngayon na. Mga sawa na sa katiwalian. CC: 1. The Ombudsman 2.

CFMC-20151550,"  Dear Secretary Singson: Magandang Buhay! This is to bring attention to your Office the incidents happening at Mt. Province DEO. Honorable Secretary, you have changed the DPWH image of being corrupt, but in MPDEO still a corrupt agency! The following are part of the practices being done by the Officials at the Agency especially the Chief, Administrative Section: 1. On July 23, 2015, a DPWH loader has fallen along the Talubin-Barlig Road. The operator is a Job Order - Norman Fonite and was in the trip ticket. However, the one who operated it in the time of falling is another Job Order named Samuel Kenept. In the police blotter & local newspaper, the Chief of the Maintenance Section and the inspector reported that a permanent employee in the person of Dencio Comafay was the operator when the loader fell. In fact, Mr. Comafay has an approved trip ticket for the Dump truck to operate at the same roadline at same dates. Due to conscience, Dencio spoke and he said he was pressured by Domingo Pumecha and Janet Valencerina to admit. These two personalities at the MPDEO even falsified the trip tickets, travel orders and the logbooks just to show that it was DENCIO COMAFAY. After sleepless nights and advises this 2nd week of August, Dencio Comafay had his sworn statement to tell the truth. It was also this time that Mr. Pumecha retracted his report at the police when in fact, there was a prior copy of the blotter that was secured. Mr. Pumecha and his men said after thorough investigation it was not Dencio. Mr Secretary, how can that be a thorough investigation when there were falsifications done? 2. WORST SCENARION Mr Secretary is the death of Mr. Arthur Padchonga, a JOB Order worker at MPDEO. Natabunan po siya sa pinapagawang kabiti ng Administrative Officer, Janet A. Valencerina, wife of the Chief of the Construction Division Clifton Valencerina, bagman of the RD at DPWH-CAR. Kasama po ng namtay ang isa ring JO. Nung mag imbsetiga ang pulisya, makikita sa logbook ng DPWH na nabura ang pangalan nila. Sinabi pa ng AO na hindi empleyado dun. Masakit po sa pamilya ni Arthur na araw-araw pumapasok ang ama sa MPDEO, ngayong namatay sinabing di empleyado. Ang pagtanggal ng maraming matagal ng JOs para mapalitan ng kamag-anak, pagdoktor sa publication ang mismong AO position noon at pag bypass sa DE ng DEO... takot lang ang mga empleyado doon na magsalita kasi may pera siya... Ito at marami pang magics ang ginagawa ng AO sa MPDEO. Honorable Secretary, ito ba ang tinatahak ng dpwh na daang matuwid? Sir, lifestyle check din sana.. We hope that the people of Bontoc, employees of DPWH Bontoc be freed from these abusive, corrupt Officals! Copies of the local newspaper and documents that were originally signed by both DPWSH and the JOs will be sent directly to your Office for your reference.

In some Multipurpose Building, the name of Congressman Douglas Hagedorn is largely printed in a banner hanging atop of the newly built infrastructures by DPWH while the information about the contractor,amount of project and other necessary information as mandated by your good office is lacking. It is very common to almost all projects been funded by the DPWH. They put a signage the indicates ""THESE IS WHERE YOUR TAX GO"" (mostly in the road projects) and in the lower part is saying ""3rd Congressional District"". May we request that it must be inspected directly from your office for we do believe that these activity were done with the blessing of DPWH officials here in Puerto Princesa",9/1/2015 15:41,1,3

I am writing to your office due to the following concern: 1.national highway clearing along surigao-agusan del norte road (alegria road section) 2. urgent clearing/removal of our residence fence that is under our patented land and been there since 1979. 3. informal notice since we did not receive any notice from the requesting team from DPWH. Sir/Madam: i have a video record of our conversation/meeting between the DPWH personnel and our mayor and municipal engr. though i dont have an idea where to attached the said video as our evidence of the said informal meeting. they just ask our presence at instant in order to discuss the said road clearing according to the office of engr.Henry Cruz J. Marapao together with engr. edel pejan of DPWH surigao city. to give you an idea our land is along national highway and is a titled private residential land (we have all the legal documents that will prove our ownership and we paid our taxes regularly advance most of the time and we never miss a single payment since we owned the lot and our house been in this land since early 70s around 1973-1974 though we owned the land years before the construction of our house. and our fence in this said land been constructed since 1979 meaning it is not covered yet in the said Road right of way for the national highway. According to our municipal mayor dominador esma jr. that he will claim portion of the land as covered in the Road right of way for some and future LGUs development in the area covered within 15 meters from the center of the national highway to our land/house and according to the group of Engr. Henry Cruz J. Marapao and Engr. Edel Pejan that they will claim the 15 meters with or without our approval since it is covered to the 15 meters.the only affected part is our fence but it is a high-end type of fence. we will obey whatever the government required as long as it is covered within the EO no. 621, s. 1980 amended EO 113, s. 1955. all we ask is that since our fence and our house been built before this Executive order, we allow the DPWH to demolished our fence granting or an exchange that the DPWH will build the same structure after the 15 meters RROW in your/DPWH own financing. but according to engr. Maraparao and Engr. pejan of surigao del norte DPWH their office will not going to finance the reconstruction of our fence since there is no appropriation given by the DPWH national office and i guess they are talking about your office. they are too harsh in explaining things that is why we did the same gesture to them. all we ask is to have some legal basis to know if what they are saying is true. because corruption is very rampant now a days among our government officials and some other LGU sector. the other point is why is it the project of clearing only affects portion near our area? why not like surigo city that everyone is covered and affected? it seems that this DPWN employees will insist that our area will be considered as one of the first batch for demolition. why not start at the boundary of agusan del norte and surigao del norte just meters away from our area? if in the event that what the surigao DPWH engrs been saying that you will not pay for the reconstruction of our fence is true, please give us some government guidelines/executive orders/ and our a copy of approved program of work in order for us to make sure that the said program of work is executable in all areas in the same year baka kami lang dahil hindi kami bomoto po sa aming mayor ngayon. and quite frankly we smell some politics involve in this project? bakit kami lang apat na pamilya lang po ang first e demolish bakit next year pa ang iba? we are hoping for your immediate answer of this matter since we are afraid that the demolition from DPWH people will start anytime soon that is what they told us yesterday. thank you for your time mrs. eden""",3/19/2015 8:27,5,5

CFMC-20150648," To: MR. Rogelio L Singson Sir, It was in the year 2011 when the good secretary with much pride told the DPWH employees that He is giving twenty thousand pesos to the BEST performing office, Ten Thousand pesos to those who performed BETTER, 5 Thousand to those whose performance are considered GOOD and none to those who did not make it to the grades. GOOD - BETTER xe2x80x93 BEST. Parang PUSOY. The C N A incentive Bonus during that time was agreed upon by the union and management at 20k. The employees then would want the reward be given to them across the board since what we do here in this agency is a team effort and the grading of offices is too subjective that only those who are close to the powers that be might receive the awards. And so it went. Comes now the disallowance made by the COA, who usually has been a recipient of C N A incentive bonus before the term of Secretary Singson except in 2011 onwards. The disallowance was based on a DBM Circular providing a ceiling of 25k to C N A incentive bonus of employees which was made known to all agencies in September, 2011. This DBM rule is like changing rules in the middle of the game. The C N A incentive Bonus before September 2011 shall be based on the savings and the general provisions stating the priority in the use of savings of the GAA for the particular year. Suddenly the DBM ceiling. PUSOY TALAGA. Me panggugulang pa kasama! The irony of it all, the good secretary also requested that the usual 10k we receive from the office of the president every Christmas be slashed to 5 thousand so we can help the victims of calamities during that year. As far as I can remember it was the Typhoon Pablo that brought destruction to the people of the Southern Philippines. But the slashed Christmas Bonus became permanent. And now since 2011, we have a Christmas bonus reduced by half permanently. Then this secretary was claiming that he is very generous to the employees of the DPWH... Double jeoparfy. Our xmas bonus was reduced by 5k per year. And already 4 years hence. We were robbed of the Christmas bonus and still you want us to refund! Have the honourable Rogelio L. Singson any notion of the Net Take home pay of the DPWH employees? Did the secretary realize that most of the employees here are receiving less than six thousand pesos a month after deducting GSIS, Taxes and Loans from various financial institutions?",5/4/2015 14:05,1,5

You already told me a lot of things with the copy I sent. The evidence is with his hands. The matter of complaint was on the Red Tape. If you showed me a picture, its only a picture but I have a lengthy letter which you did not mention. It was not me who hindered this, right? To tell you frankly, you have made a big mistake. You are trying to insult me for my apparent lack of knowledge.            Its top secret that it went off, is because you are afraid of Drilon and possibly will be said  against the DPWH head, Secretary Singson. Perhaps you are afraid that it may awaken some of the sentiments and construction shall drop in DPWH since you have been designated as the chief of the information division and feedback liaison officer in the DPWH.       One of the obligations of your office is to publicize the bidding process to all the people of Paquibato who won the ""Dire"" camp Gulones Km. 1-2 to 4 and km 7. How much construction cost which is supposedly in the 3 billion plus ""signage"". Why is  it that they will not mention how much was spent for one kilometer, one billion for Km 1-2 and for Km 4 it reached 1 billion.

CFMC-20150825,"  A good friend friend of mine Joji Baggao- Borromeo from Ilagan City in Isabela posted these pictures of terrible traffic in the mountain highways in Nueva Vizcaya which we from Isabela and Cagayan provinces have to travel and cross every time we visit our hometowns. Every year we experience such terrible traffics due to the constant road repairs done by the DPWH and their contractors - surprisingly every year. They have this crazy practice of boring holes on stretches of roads that are supposed to be repaired even as these are still passable. Presumably they do this to immediately collect the mobilization funds even as their construction timetables would take months and even years. Then they start repairing one side of the road there by creating long stretches of one way traffic in mountain highways of bends and curves causing terrible road congestion and unbearable traffic jams that could take even a whole day. This insensitive approach by DPWH and their contractors must change. Regular travelers and motorists and I hope the businessmen as well, from Cagayan Valley should now unite and take a stand from this abuse and lack of concern about the comforts of the commuter. This also takes its toll on the speed of transporting the produce from the Cagayan Valey region which eventually would affect prices of commodities as the transport cost shall be inputted to the final cost of the product when it reaches the market. Moreover it tremendously affects the quality and final price of perishable products like meat and vegetable. KAWAWA NAMAN ANG MGA TAGA CAGAYAN VALLEY. The DPWH need a change of not only its contractors but in strategy!  Perhaps its time to build a new highway in the Eastern Seaboard of Luzon from Aurora Province to reach Cagayan Valley! This will not only improve traffic flow and transport speed but will also open up huge economic opportunities in the east coast of Isabela and Cagayan provinces. Yung design ng Highway ay dapat cut and fill para straight line siya, in order to make distance and time travel shorter! As much as possible dapat six lanes para walang closed traffic during repairs and reblocking! Our politicians and highway Engineers should visit and learn from Vietnam and Thailand.

People from outside our locality used to say, ""Kapagal na ning dalan yo."" It means it does not rest because it is not properly done by the local DPWH, it doesn	 last longer, one year or two, it deteriorates easily. Last time we spearheaded a signature campaign and submitted the list of concerned citizens to the main office to monitor the construction of the said road,but what happened the complaint went back to the local level, and we agreed with the local dpwh engineers that we will witness the coring. But I was informed with the coring on the day itself 920am and the coring is 930am, leaving us to have no chance to leave our work immediately. So these people were very insincere and acted in bad faith. At present the road is under construction again, in line with the TUWID NA DAAN"" of Pres. Aquino, we would like to implore your good office Sec. Singson to really monitor this road project, to observe the proper PSI, since it is being passed by trucks. As of now we are forced to pass a rough road for rerouting, making our vehicles suffer damages, like our car. We are paying our taxes to enjoy or benefit from the basic services of the government.

CFMC-20151111,"  DEAR DPWH SECRETARY SINGSON: Something is not right in Eastern Samar.... There is a huge billboard proclaiming a P35 million ""preventive maintenance"" project covering a stretch of national highway that should be the envy of so many other LgUs.... Because it remains in good shape. And yet the DPWH will let a contractor dig it up and repave it?? For P35 Million? I don	 know if you have even traversed this stretch of highway but please do and soon. Before admin opponents pounce on it as an example of questionable projects as the elections near. And before the jackhammer does its work and actually destroys what is still good road!  I know you are an honorable man Secretary Singson but this Eastern Samar project stinks. I wouldn	 be surprised if some investigative reporter picks up on this issue and exposes it on national tv or in the dailies. Then DAANG MATUWIDs critiques will have a heyday. Why and how do these things happen anyway? Even under your watch? (Ellen Tordesillas this is something for Vera Files if you ask me. Cecilia Victoria O. Drilon unless you want to pick this up? ) My cellphone ran out of battery due to the video clips I took of this road so if you need them just let me know. Because some people may not be telling you what you need to know.  We have never met but one member of the Cabinet, DOTC Secretary Abaya, knows me quite well and how insistent I can be when I pick up on an issue, since a few years back I picked up on an issue involving Secretary Abayas brother Peter, taking the latter side, and didn	 let go. I feel as strongly about this matter as I did about the case of then DENR Usec Peter Abaya... So I hope you or your staff can explain why a highway as good as this one from Lawaan to Buenavista will be dug up to the tune of P35 million - which could be better spent building roads where none exist at the moment. And I suspect there are still a lot of places in Eastern Samar which fit the bill...  Thank you po.",7/7/2015 9:34,4,6

It was originally a provincial road as seen in old titles and map but turned to a barangay road now. It is a 500m road rehabilitation I think to replace the asphalt road here in Brgy Maturanoc, Guimba, Nueva Ecija. I have two concerns about the construction sir. It is only a barangay road now and its elevation is too high after the construction is done, another sir is that i dont see that putting sands on top of an asphalt before concreting will not affect its stability. Ill be glad to hear from you sir since im not familiar with engineering works especially road construction. Thank you very much sir. Good day again sir. An Engineer already showed up here a while ago and showed the plan for the road rehabilitation project here. Additional query sir, take note sir that the asphalt is already jack hammered and holes are made before they put sand on top of it. What we think is that it should be done only when the asphalt is for removal.

CFMC-20151845,"  We made a private road in our farm last year 2014 so that our vehicle can do down the hill and park near the house since we carry heavy things and farm products. Now, we cannot pass in our road anymore because the road is impassable. It was too high and no culvert according to my husband since he went to the visit our farm but had to park the car in the roadside. There was even no means for a person to pass, how much more for our 4-wheel vehicle.I talked over the phone with the contractor, Annabi Cagalawan of Cagalawan Enterprises but she said it is not in their scope in the contract. She blamed DPWH personnel who she said is responsible for not looking into the effects of the new road construction to our property road. I am writing this complaint because, I am seeking that our problem be resolved. We were very happy when we knew that the main road was cemented but then we are more sad because we cannot get inside our property anymore. Hoping for your immediate action.   I forgot to put the details of my previous mail. Our property is in Malanang Opol Misamis Oriental. We bought last year a portion of the land from our neighbor for our entrance since our property is in the inner lot. We spent a lot in making the private road so that our car can go downhill to our property. But now, we cannot pass because the road is too high with a canal-like structure (no culvert or cover to the side) which is also dangerous. The contractor - Cagalawan Enterprises said, it is not their concern since it is not part of the scope of their contract. According to her, it was the neglect of DPWH surveyors. Our entrance is almost 3 meters wide facing the mainroad and there are flaglets to distinguish that it is an entrance and there is a private road going down the hill. The private road can easily be seen since the main road is on the higher grounds. Now our property road is impassable. If only there is a connection from the main road to our road by way of covering the ""canal"" so that the vehicles/persons will not fall. Please help us resolve this situation.",10/13/2015 14:25,4,6

I would like to complain about a recently repaired stretch of road here in Bacolod City, specifically the Alijis Murcia road as this road had several sections repaired (finished around last month). Although it was finished only recently (last month), the cement portions have began to peel off revealing the stones underneath used in making the concrete. I have inquired around and the people I asked said that this is called scaling and should not happen for a long time. I am complaining as a private citizen as I have noted that several road repairs in Bacolod recently finished also exhibit this poor quality of construction. I am not sure if this is the same company that you contracted but I hope that you give this the attention it deserves. Under the ""Daang Matuwid,"" we hoped that the quality of public construction would be better than the previous. If this shoddy and poor quality work continues and is allowed to continue by the DPWH, our country is going nowhere and all the slogans we see on your website and on TV are simply just that.

And yet, Engr Saliganan made this as a pathetic excuse of not meeting his deadline. As we know, when a deadline is not met, it is wasting valuable resources and eventually wasting taxpayers money! The past months have not been really that wet compared to past years. The rain has been minimal to impact a really well planned and well executed projects. This doesn	 seem to be one. I request that a spot check by DPWH Manila inspectors be conducted to ensure these projects have not been compromised and taxpayers money had not been unnecessarily wasted. The concreting of these National project is still allegedly ""ongoing"" and yet we have noticed very few movements of equipments for such projects. Of a grave concern too, is the seemingly substandard quality of concreting of these projects. You can not travel more than 4 kilometres of these

CFMC-20160514,"  The Honorable Secretary Department of Public Works and Highways Port Area Manila  Sir:  I accidentally came into possession of a leaflet with an inscription as: Secretaryxe2x80x99s Corner: Let us know what you think: - this leaflet encouraged and emboldened me to write this letter. My concern is about the Road Widening Project that your Department is presently implementing and constructing at the Capital town of Virac, province of Catanduanes. Primordially, I am personally pleased by this project because it serves, among others as a timely solution to an increasing vehicular and pedestrian traffic, now experienced in this town. Please note that the road, upon which your project is going on, traverses the area where usually populated establishments are to be found, such as, the Provincial Hospital, the Airport and Catanduanes State University to name some. The main intention of this letter is to call the attention and bring to the knowledge of your good office and person the many shortcomings or defects in the construction of the above-mentioned project which I have personally noticed and observed in my capacity as a non-engineer person. Such observations are the following: The Road-widening project includes the construction of a drainage system in the form of a line-canal underneath the concrete pavement. However, the drainage system, part of the widening works is so constructed that it avoids as it swerves away from private structures built along the right-of-way portion of the area traversed by the drainage system. As a result, the finished portion of the project appear zigzagging. This observation is best manifested in the following private structures found setting outright on the area of right of way of the project to wit: 1. Portion fronting Funenaria Bugtong xe2x80x93 the drainage was made to swerve away from the establishment as it passes in front of the funeral parlor. Reports however has it that in the construction of the building of said funeral house, its owner was made to sign a waiver that he is to remove the structure when the government should need the area. 2. Portions of the total length of the drainage system were constructed inside concrete fences of some residential houses but it left behind the fences untouched negating the very purpose of the project which is to widen the National Road. Recently, however, said fences were now removed but leaving behind fences belonging to former Governor Leandro Verceles Jr. and one belonging to a certain Segundo Gianan, both of whom are influential family in this province. As a result, the project is a picture of zigzag pathway alongside the more or less straight national road. 3. Portion of the Project near and horizontal to the concrete fence of the airport is now completed, but the work left behind a hilly or a protruding concrete pavement not visible from a distance. The uneven pavement makes that portion of the national road hazardous. 4. Before the construction of present drainage system, there was already an existing open line canal in front of the airport runway. This line canal cater to the floodwaters naturally flowing from the runway through holes at the foot of the concrete fence saving the national road from flooding. Present construction works discarded the old open canal and constructed in its instead a closed drainage system. Consequently, depriving floodwaters its natural flow from the runway to the drainage system. As a result, the highway floods when it rains, which was not the case with the old open canal system. 5. At the junction of the national road and Moonwalk road, a provincial road, there is an existing lateral drainage system that directs the flow of waters to the open line canal along Moonwalk road. The construction work of the new drainage system disregarded the simple fact that the old lateral drainage system is too narrow in width to accommodate the increased volume of floodwaters that flow under the expanded drainage system of subject project. 6. Also, because of the No. 5 circumstance, the bulk of the floodwaters will flow directly to the low grounds where the Provincial Hospital and many residential houses are located. This may lead to floodings in said area. It must be noted that the purpose of the lateral drainage canal was to redirect the flow of floodwaters to the open line canal along Moonwalk Road where existing drainage system could accommodate larger volume of floodwaters. Again, this simple engineering factor was evidently ignored.  In view of the foregoing, we respectfully request your good office to conduct a thorough investigation so as to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings in the implementation and construction of the subject Road Widening Project.    Respectfully Yours,",5/17/2016 12:46,4,6
CFMC-20160527,"  Name: Yolanda Alvarado Address: Dasmarixc3xb1as City, Cavite Contact details: yta81859@yahoo.com / 0922-893-9353  This is Mrs. Yolanda Alvarado, a resident from Dasmarixc3xb1as City, Cavite. Ang concern ko ay tungkol sa isang project along Brgy. Luzviminda II, Area F, Dasmarixc3xb1as City, Cavite specifically in front of Bahay Pangarap Subdivision. A road project was started here recently near a creek. Before na gawin ang project na xe2x80x98yon, we donxe2x80x99t have a problem kasi hindi naman nag o-overflow ang creek. Noong ginagawa ang kalsada, nagkaroon ng tambak in both sides of the road which blocked the water na makapunta sa creek. Then, recently noong umulanxe2x80x94 about two days agoxe2x80x94 nagulat kami kasi biglang bumaha sa mga bahay ng residents doon. Never na bumaha ng ganoong katindi doon. Dati, kapag naulan, manageable ang situation. Pero nitong nakaraan, konting ulan lang ganon na agad kalala ang sitwasyon. Pumasok sa mga bahay ang napakaruming tubig at mga basura. Worst is hanggang baywang ang baha! First time talaga na nag-overflow ang creek at pumunta sa mga bahay ang tubig. Affected ang mga business ng local residents at may unexpected damages sa mga bahay. Yesterday, I talked to a man namely Damaso Constantino to address my concern. Ixe2x80x99am not sure if hexe2x80x99s an engineer but I think he is. Tinanong ko kung sino ang may handle ng project pero sabi nxe2x80x99ya di raw sa DPWH, sa Sub-district engineering daw. Gusto ko lang iparating ang reklamo ko dahil parang wala naman silang ginagawa sa after effect ng project. Yes, nakumpleto ang road project at guminhawa ang mga jeepney driver pero papatayin naman nila ang mga residente. Napaka-delikado lalo na sa mga bata na naglalaro malapit sa creek. I suggest immediate action regarding my concern. Please have an inspection here to know the exact situation at ang after effect ng ginawang road project dito. Dati, hindi nangyayari yang mga xe2x80x98yan. Pero about two days pa lang after project completion, ganyan agad ang effect sa ulan. Paano pa kapag bagyo na?  Madalas na umulan ngayon at pag hindi nasolusyunan, delikado para sa mga residente. Nakakatakot ang bulwak ng tubig talagang delikado. Please have an immediate response regarding my concern.

If it is, then why in the second district of Leyte Engineering District painted with broken lines the center of the road instead on the lines next to the center especially on areas where roads were already widened with four lanes? I know the project was not yet finished but I guess it is a waste of money to buy paint to be marked on the wrong side of the road?

CFMC-20150463,"  Greetings! This is to report stalled road repair located at Longos, Bacoor, Cavite. I noticed that this said repair was already in progress since my arrival from Australia in January 11, 2015 but was not completed since then. For the record, itxe2x80x99s been more than two months now since I saw this xe2x80x9con-going constructionxe2x80x9d. Though there is little progress since January, unfortunately and just to emphasize, the remaining unpaved part of the road takes more than two months now and counting. As of this writing, it is not even improving at any pace, as there were no construction workers working on it (day or night) and the truck is apparently stuck only for display. Please note and as we know, this remaining unpaved road has caused massive traffic jams every morning and afternoon/evening especially during rush hours, including even weekends. Again as a matter of fact during morning rush hours, vehicles from Cavite to Manila needs to counter flow and occupy the opposite lane/direction just to lessen the burden of those going to their offices, among other errands. However, this is still not an effective and efficient way to address the situation which also compromises the time/resources of those going to Cavite, and ultimately worsens the traffic condition further. As you are probably aware of, this has adverse effects to peoplexe2x80x99s productivity, resources such as money and time, among other delays such as delivery of goods etc. Attached are some pictures I personally took supporting my report for your information, reference and appreciation of what is the reality. I hope that concerned agencies take this seriously and with utmost urgency so as not to cause further adverse effects to the people, and the economy as a whole.

Now I am writing again to ask if the project has ended. this area seems to have been left uncompleted - the culverts and canals have been like that since march. what are they waiting for this time? and look what they did to the property...they bulldozed the land and created that gap when it was not necessary after all. Then the chapel, the residents could not hold mass because of the mud, the water from the road now goes inside the chapel because no culvert was placed to divert the rain water. The culvert at the other side seems to have been left just like that...when will they attend to this? when the rains come? Please do not wait that I will again write the Secretary directly. I hope you can do something about all of these.",4/27/2015 8:54,4,7

CFMC-20151612,"  Ang post na ito ay naglalayong ipaabot sa kinauukulan ang isa sa mga suliranin na nagiging dahilan ng kahirapan sa mga motorista na bumabaybay sa Brgy. Tiling, Cauayan, Negros Occidental papuntang bayan ng Cauayan. Sa nasasakupan ng Brgy. Tiling ay may binungkal na dalawang maliliit na tulay na kung tutuusin ay hindi umabot sa sampung metro (10 meters) ang bawat isa. Ito ay sinimulang bungkalin at isara sa trapiko halos mahigit isang taon na ang nakalilipas (more or less). Naging sagabal ito sa daloy ng trapiko sa bahaging ito ng National Highway dahil sa kawalan ng tamang bantay. Isa pa sa nagpalala sa sitwasyon ay ang kasalukuyang kalagayan ng mga tulay na ito na ayon sa aming pagmamatyag ay may ganitong problema: 1. Kawalan ng tinatawag na Project Information Board na naglalaman ng petsa kung kalian inumpisahan at matatapos ang proyekto, pangalan ng contractor ng proyekto, kabuuhang halaga ng proyekto at lugar ng proyekto; 2. Sabay na binungkal at isinara ang dalawang tulay at sabay rin na hindi ginagawa; 3. Kawalan ng nakaduty na mga xe2x80x9cFlagmenxe2x80x9d na magbabantay sa mga paparating na sasakyan at magkontrol sa trapiko; 4.

Kailan maipagpapatuloy ang pagtrabaho sa mga tulay na ito? 2. Kailan matatapos ang proyektong ito? 3. Bakit walang nakapaskil na pangalan ng contractor sa lugar ng proyekto na sa alituntunin ng Department of Public Works and Highways, bawat proyekto ay dapat nakalagay ang pangalan ng contractor? 4. Bakit kailangang sabay na bungkalin at isara ang dalawang tulay kung di naman pala sabay na gagawin? Bilang mga mamamayan na palaging bumabaybay sa pangunahing kalsadang ito, nais naming maisaayos ang mga ito upang mawala ang mga agam-agam ng naming sa kinauukulan.

They started with digging holes last 10 September 2015, Thursday using a heavy equipment then no one work last Friday and Saturday. They continue digging last Monday and Tuesday but started after lunch then no one work again yesterday. May I know what is this project? How come the work is staggered and starting after lunch only, I am wondering why so? What is the timeline of this project? They are suppose to work everyday and 8 hours a day right? So they can finish early and on time. It is really a hassle that they dug the street and it seems that there is no urgency to finish it. Please explain. And also kindly call the attention of the contractor to do their job diligently so we can have full access of the road soonest time possible.

CFMC-20151760,"  The Ribsuan bridge along Baguio - Bauang road had already been closed to trucks in the last quarter of 2014. It was reopened to all types of vehicles early 2015 but again closed to trucks last September 17,2015. Earlier this year, we noticed a DPWH signage posted on both ends of the bridge to wit: REPLACEMENT OF (PERMANENT) WEAK BRIDGE, RIBSUAN BRIDGE CONTRACTOR: ST. GERRARD CONSTRUCTION DATE STARTED: MARCH 5, 2015 CONTRACT DURATION: 182 CALENDAR DAYS CONTRACT COST: PHP 59,427,143.31 IMPLEMENTING OFFICE: DPWH, REGION I What saddens us is that the contract duration for the replacement bridge is almost over, but no semblance yet of a new bridge to be erected is visible,not a single post whatsoever can be seen. What can be seen in the area is that they are repairing a very small portion (12 sqm) of the pavement of the old steel bridge, and its taking them forever. We haul our cement from Holcim at Bacnotan, La Union; our hollowblocks from Bauang, and concrete aggregates from Naguillan. We waste so much time and fuel if we pass thru Marcos Highway, aside from the danger it poses to life and property because of its very steep terrain. We also aggravate the traffic at the city proper if all trucks pass thru Marcos high way. Finally, Naguillan/Quirino highway is a major thoroughfare, there is no wisdom in closing a portion of it to trucks because this will negatively impact on businesses. At least, provide a detour route.",10/6/2015 8:51,5,7

I am saying it severely since the project does not only took few weeks but almost more than a year already of heavy traffic, long walks of our children when going to school, dirt it caused in the area that are almost hazardous when commuting and so much more even in little things that makes your day in a bad mood. In addition, what annoys the people here is that the work of the project stopped from time to time causing delays due to changing of contractors which we heard due to budget issues. My apologies if this mail was sent to all email address I found on your site since I am not sure who is the right person to approach but I found courage to do so when your contractor blocked the street corner going to our houses on which no means of transportation can enter and knowing today that it was stopped because there is no budget to continue the task.

Halos isang linggo matapos ilathala ng Angono Rizal News Online (aRNO) ang dalawang taon nang nabibinbin na tulay sa Darangan, personal na pinuntahan ng aRNO kaninang Huwebes ng umaga, January 21, ang munisipyo ng Binangonan upang kunin ang update, ang kanilang pahayag, at para sa patas na pag-uulat ukol sa developing story na ito. Partikular na pinuntahan ng aRNO ang Engineering Department pero wala umano ang otorisadong magsalita ukol dito. Hindi rin pinapasok ang aRNO sa nasabing opisina pero may dalawang staff dito ang kumausap sa aRNO sa lobby. Humingi ng pahintulot ang aRNO sa babae at lalaki na staff para makuha ang kanilang pangalan para sa ulat na ito, pero tumanggi sila. Ayon sa dalawang staff, maging ang Pamahalaang Bayan ng Binangonan ay nababahala sa mabagal na paggawa sa tulay na proyekto ng DPWH Region IV-A. Ayon pa sa nakausap ng aRNO, ang dahilan kung bakit hindi pa rin natatapos ang tulay ay dahil sa hindi pa rin umano natatapos ng Manila Water na ayusin ang mga tubo at daluyan ng tubig na maaapektuhan sa paggawa ng tulay. xe2x80x9cMasikip din kasi yung lugar kaya hindi nagkakasya ang mga malalaking equipment na kailangan para sa paggawa ng tulay,xe2x80x9d wika ng nakausap ng aRNO. Ang paliwanag ng dalawang staff ay halos katulad din ng comment ng isang mambabasa ng aRNO sa nasabing isyu. xe2x80x9cTinanong ko yung kaibigan ko sa DPWH (kung) ano nangyari dyan sa tulay. Delay daw yan kasi bukod sa pinakamasikip na tulay daw yan sa Binangonan na part ng widening project eh ang tagal umaksyon ng PLDT MERALCO at Manila Waters. Hirap daw heavy equipment dyan kasi nakadikit sa residential at commercial building pero tentative date daw ng tapos nyan eh sa February or March. Naka-fabricate na yung part na ikakabit daw dyan,xe2x80x9d wika ni aRNO reader Edmund Dantes. Nang tanungin din ang staff sa nasabing opisina kung matatapos ngayong taon ang tulay, hindi naman ito tiyak na nasagot ng kausap ng aRNO dahil depende nga ito sa ikikilos ng Manila Water at DPWH Region IV-A. Samantala, sa Martes ay pupunta ang aRNO sa DPWH Region IV-A sa opisina nito sa Quezon City upang kuhanan sila ng update at pahayag.",2/4/2016 10:16,4,7

Our complaint is that these unfinished road sections has been causing tremendous traffic since late last year up to now, especially during rush hour because the widened road seems to have reverted to a one-lane two-way traffic upon reaching these places. What irritates most motorists is that these portions are practically the busiest portions of the urban area part of the national highway in Puerto Princesa City, if not for the entire Province of Palawan. The contractor left these unfinished portions idle and untouched for several months already, proceeding its concreting of the road shoulders instead to the outskirts of the city (rural part).

It had a target completion but it was moved yet we understand that there maybe complexities that the contractor and government is going through and still we waited patiently.But our dilemma right now is that its been months already since the completion was moved and that the project was in no progress. We The Students,workers and travelers are already suffering from the rerouting which add up minutes if not hours to our travel time, instead of spending it with our families and our studies or work if not rest,not to mention the increase in the fare and fuel which could have been used to other important things. I know all things are due to process but we hope that the project be not delayed anymore and that the historical value of the bridge be sustained. We hope that the project may be done already, the steel bars are already laid into place and waiting,concrete is the only thing needed to be poured for it to be finished that it will be back to its functionality. And not to mention the more the delay the more the money of the people is spent.Hence, we know there is still ripening/maturing time for the concrete. So may we sincerely ask your Honorable office to do an action that the Project be not be delayed anymore for the monsoon/rainy months are coming and it will not be an ache to all of us to travel around due to the rerouting, and that our parents,husband/wife,Family,Co-workers,friends etc. wont be worried about our safety and travel time anymore.

CFMC-20160490,"  Dearest Secretary Singson, Shalom ! I am a regular biyahero from Manila to Ifugao and vise versa every week as I am working in Manila. Sad to report as a concern citizen that the usual travel of 9 hours from Manila to Ifugao is taking us now almost 18 to 22 hours just because of a very simple re-blocking project of the DPWH from Sta Fe to San Jose. Many Foreigners and some local tourists including me from Banaue and Sagada who missed their international and local flights were so angry because no one from the ground even the policemen passing cannot provide information what is happening with the traffic menace. Drivers from either lane to manila and to the north to Viscaya, Quirino, Isabela, Cagayan, Aparri, Kalinga, Mountain Province and Ifugao are shouting to the foreigners IT IS MORE FUN IN THE PHILIPPINES. MABUHAY ANG DAANG MATUWID!!! With these remarks of disgust from the public, I was so ashamed as a Civil Engineer like you are and this prompted me to search for the DPWH grievance redress mechanism hotline from your website but found your email ad. This are my concerns: i) the traffic everyday at that section if not given attention immediately is next to economic sabotage. The cost of missed flights, office hours, goods undelivered is already enormous than the cost of a very simple re-blocking that did not consider traffic management and its repercussion at all by the contractor and an insensitive regional or district DPWH offices. Imagine, some are already sacrificing to use the Ambuklao road via Baguio just to go to manila because of the mismanagement of the re-blocking that is taking too long. ii) Daang Matuwid and your Unquestionable Integrity and Performance Hon. Singson that regain the respect for DPWH will go down the drain just because of what is now happening to Dalton Pass. iii) Many voters will be disenfranchise for those who will be leaving manila to the provinces and from the provinces to Manila on the night of May 8,2016 because by then they will only arrive home about 6PM of May 9,2016 as what we are experiencing since the latest re-blocking project started. (actual experience today May 1-2,2016 left banaue ifugao at 7 pm on Sunday, reach aritao at 10pm and stranded sta fe until 8Am of Monday and reach manila 6PM of Monday) Suggestions: i) there are several single PCCP blocks that were removed and replaced and are causing one way traffic, can we design this for a 3-7 days concrete and cover these with metal flat sheets so that it can be opened to traffic right away. Further, the shoulder could be widened and improved temporarily as detour. ii) For several short span bridges (about 5) undergoing retrofitting: Why are they not constructed simultaneously and immediately after the steel bars and form works are placed. Again, these can be provided with bypass over the prepared section and or inclusion of detour. For instance, I saw one bridge is finished and what was remaining is the approach connection only but was left undone and it causes one way traffic for several days already, why? Another bridge with in-placed steel bars but not poured. This will go viral in social media am sure in the next few days if no improvement will be made to reduce the inconveniences of the riding public.

Hindi naman po sa minamadali kaso napapansin na din po ng mga tao dito na sobrang bagal ng mga gumagawa. Madalas e makikita mo silang nakatambay at nagke-kwentuhan. Kapansin-pansin po talaga ang kanilang kabagalan. Ang sasakyan po namin hindi na namin maiuwi since last year dahil sa road construction na ginagawa nila. Yung ibang mga nasementong kalsada pa po ay pachi-pachi ang gawa parang chessboard. May mga parte pa ng kalsada na hindi pa nasesementuhan. At dahil nag-uulan na nitong mga nakaraang araw, naiipunan ito ng tubig at nagdudulot ng baha. At nung nakaraan nga ay may nahulog na matandang babae dahil marupok ang ginawa nilang tulay na kahoy. Itinawag ko na din po ito sa inyong hotline at sinabi na isend ko din sa fb page ninyo para maipost ko ang mga picture.   Eto pong picture na ito ay intersection. Kung mapapansin ninyo ay halos hindi sya madaanan ng mga sasakyan. Yung isang side na galing at papuntang Elga street lang ang makakadaan.  Eto naman yung part na hindi pa nasesementuhan. Puno na ng tubig dahil sa ulan at hindi man lang ginawan ng daluyan ng tubig.  Eto yung isa lang parte na walang semento  Eto naman yung binuhusan nila ng semento pero nasira yung plywood na umaalalay sa ilalim. Hindi ko maintindihan kung dapat ba talagang may plywood since sesementuhan naman sya. Tatlong araw na nilang pinupukpok ng martilyo at pako yang semento. Kung mapapansin nyo ang dami nila nakapwesto dyan pero lamang ang kwentuhan nila  Sana po ay maaksyunan nyo ito. Alam ko na hindi ganun kabilis gumawa ng kalsada pero hindi naman po siguro kailangan abutin ng ilang bwan para magawa nila ng maayos yung kalye namin. Maraming salamat po.

CFMC-20150167,"  Good afternoon, I tried to send this through the feed back page on your website but I kept getting an internal server error. Good afternoon,  I would like to share an event that took place today in Matalom, Leyte about 10:30am January 28, 2015, that involved a construction project site on the national highway. Unfortunately I was involved in vehicular accident on the site of one of your contractors. Fortunately the accident was not very serious (no loss of life) but I believe this could have been avoided. Before entering the area (the stretch of highway where work is being performed) there were no warning signs. I spoke with some of the residents who live in the area and this was a great concern with them as well because there are a number of children in the area. Another issue was the debris on the highway. The gravel left behind on the road is what actually caused my motorcycle tires to lose traction resulting in the accident, a local resident helped me and picked up my motorcycle and moved it out of the traffic lane on the highway. I spoke with several different drivers (PUJ and Tricycle) today and they complained about the same problems. After the accident I called my husband and told him what happened and to come to the scene. After my husband arrived, the driver of one of the trucks placed one yellow warning triangle about two meters behind the trailer of his truck which was parked about 10cm away from the highway lane itself. An action such as this shows the driver of the truck knew he was wrong so he quickly put the warning device out before the manager arrived. A few moments later the manager and his assistant arrived. I must say I was surprised at the way they spoke to me, not only did they start to speak aggressively and loudly at me they also angrily told me how wrong I was about them putting warning signs out for the other drivers on the highway. Not one time did they ask if I was ok or showed any compassion even though I was standing there bruised and bleeding. They treated me as if I was beneath them, not worthy of speaking to them and offended that I dare ask them about warning sings. I called the police to come for my safety because of the hostile behavior of the manager and his assistant with the backing of the construction crew. My husband asked why there were no warning sings placed and why did they not remove the debris from the road, the assistant said xe2x80x9cthis is the Philippines, not Americaxe2x80x9d I could not believe he said that. I am a Filipina proud of my country and countrymen, his statement suggests that because we are Filipino we are somehow inferior to Americans, as if we donxe2x80x99t have to follow rules, I do not share his opinion of my country and my people, I sincerely hope the DPWH who employs this contractor does not share his opinion either. I asked the manager to put warning signs out then he said to me xe2x80x9csee you in courtxe2x80x9d as he walked back to his truck. Shortly after the police arrived and I explained what happened. The police officer agreed there should be warning signs in the area for approaching drivers he also mentioned the debris on the road. The police officer asked the manager about the debris (gravel and mud) on the road and he said they did not put it there even though they have the only construction equipment in the area. I drive this stretch of highway two times every day as well as many local drivers, we all say the same thing, the debris from the road is obviously from the construction site, it was not there before they started the work here. After the police spoke to them they agreed to put warning signs on the highway and the assistant manager said to the workers xe2x80x9cmen at workxe2x80x9d while laughing and poking his index finger into the palm of his other hand which we know to be an obscene gesture. Today is a day that truly saddened me, to be treated at a level of disrespect that is absolutely unwarranted and unacceptable in any circumstance especially from a company contracted by the DPWH which is a part of the government of the country that I love. I sincerely hope the DPWH does not condone such behavior from its contractors and will take proper steps to ensure their contractors treat our fellow citizens with dignity and respect that we all deserve. Thank you for your assistance and God bless.",2/5/2015 14:55,4,8

CFMC-20150505,"  Dept of Public Works & Highways Bonifacio Drive, Port Area Manila  March 25, 2015  Attn:  Secretary Rogelio Singson 	 Dear Sir,  I am Criselda delos Reyes, formally file my complaint against your sub-contractor Steven Construction. I really need your help with this.  The accident happened on 2015 of March 07 Saturday between 12:00 NN xe2x80x93 1:30 PM when we were passing along A. Mendoza St. Sta Cruz Manila.  The construction worker carrying a pail (bucket) on his shoulder  suddenly hit the right side mirror of my vehicle when he  came out from the concrete barrier of the construction site that causes my vehiclexe2x80x99s  side mirror broken.  It happened due to the contractorxe2x80x99s negligence and lack of early device warning.  During my inquiry, Ixe2x80x99ve learned that Steven Construction was not prepared and not ready for the safety of their workers and motorists as well.   I am also stating some of our conversation I recalled during the incident and after the admission of their faults.  When I stopped and asked the worker why he had to come out from the barrier, he replied back by telling me xe2x80x9cnasaktan na nga po ako eh, puede naman kami lumabas anytime na gusto namenxe2x80x9d. I asked him, bakit ka nasaktan when you are carrying a bucket on your shoulder?? Is it proper doing that in your workplace??   The work area and the space provided inside were enough for them to walk through (attached picture) and that made me questioned him of his reasons for coming out from the barrier.    He just walked out and said nothingxe2x80xa6   I asked from other workers the person in-charged of the project because something came up but no one cares from the superiors; even if we had an accident or any discomfort from the worker involved.   Then, a person came forward not far from the incident and introduces himself as the Foreman.   I asked him about the broken side mirror and the person involved, explained to him their responsibility as a contractor because of negligence and lack of safety devices. He just told me xe2x80x9ckausapin nyo na lang po yung taong nasaktan at pwede naman kami lumabas (from barrier) anytime kasi nagta-trabaho kami ditoxe2x80x9d. I was really surprised because he doesnxe2x80x99t really know the safety of his people including the by-passers and motorists like us. I asked him if therexe2x80x99s another person in-charged of the project who can handle the situation and he pointed the Engineer who happened to be a few steps away from us. The Foreman walked out and said to my brother xe2x80x9cbayaran nyo na lang kasi ng panggamot para dina kayo maabala pa.xe2x80x9d  The Engineer on site introduces himself as Engineer Ariel.  My brother asked him about the safety devices like the caution tape and he replied back xe2x80x9csa gabi lang po namin nilalagay Sirxe2x80x9d. We were shocked and asked him again, xe2x80x9cdi ba kayo nagtatrabaho pag araw? Dapat di nyu inaalis and caution tape, dapat ayusin nyo workplace ng site.xe2x80x9d Followed up by asking him, xe2x80x9cbakit kulang ang mga safety devices nyo and even the workers walang alam sa safety?xe2x80x9d He just said  xe2x80x9cdi naman po ako nagkulang ng paalala sa tao koxe2x80xa6.xe2x80x9d and to stop us maybe from  questioning,  he continued by saying xe2x80x9cnakausap ko na po yun boss ko, sasagutin daw po ang damages at ayusin na lang po natin para matapos naxe2x80x9d I asked him the name of their company but he refused to give the address, email add and the contact numbers. He said, its in  Ortigas and far from Manila but everyday naman daw sya nasa site and gave me his CP number 0947 601 1907 instead, and promised to pay for the damages because he acknowledges their fault then we left from the site believing that we have a gentlemanxe2x80x99s agreement.  So we went directly to Ford Alabang after my appointment in Manila to get the quotation (attached) for the side mirror as I have thought, it will be fixed the same day.   The service advisor told us, that it will be replaced after 3 weeks provided we will pay in advance to ship the item. I made a phone call to Engr. Ariel to 0947 601 1907  using my husbandxe2x80x99s CP#0917 824 5869 and he agreed to pay but according to him, he will wait for his boss who has also busy with their project in Bicol and will be here in Manila the following week.  I told him, the time is important to us because my vehiclexe2x80x99s side mirror was broken and needed a replacement the soonest but we have to pay in advance to place the order. I told him that this is not what we have agreed while we were in Manila and he started to discuss with me the driverxe2x80x99s liability and I replied back to him that it would be better if he will talk to my counsel instead of putting all the blame in me.  He told me, may abogado din daw ang kumpanya nila at may pananagutan ako kaya ukey lang daw naman then I told him bakit pa sya nakikipag-ayos sakin if sila ang victim at ako person na may pananagutan.  He told me, hindi nya ako bine-blame but nag-explain lang sya sa driverxe2x80x99s liability dahil nasaktan ang tao nya at nakikipag-ayos na sya dahil may fault din daw sila. Hindi ko man lang daw dinala ang tao nya sa hospital para ipagamot because masakit daw ang shoulder. I told him, it was his responsibility because he is the superior and should look after the safety of his people.  He told me, he asked the worker to be checked in the hospital but refused to come. If the worker was badly hurt, he cannot standstill and work after the incident.   During the incident, my 15 year old son approached the worker if he is okey but he just left and ignore my sonxe2x80x99s concerned. Another fact, if hexe2x80x99s responsible enough he may come hurriedly during the time when the accident is happening and not to display his concerned after accepting their faults. If I didnxe2x80x99t ask, he wouldnxe2x80x99t comexe2x80xa6. is that how a responsible superior should be acting??  Our phone conversation that day, ended in the agreement of sending them the amount to be paid to inform his boss. I sent him a text message with the amount after the phone conversation using my cp number 0916 323 7224 of March 07 2015. On Monday of March 09 2015,  I was on my way to the nearest police station of where the incident happened I made another call to Engr. Ariel using my cp number 0916 323 7224. I also texted him at around 9:30 am and attached with this also my text conversation with him. He did not reply so I went to the station to blotter as per my friendxe2x80x99s advice because it should be done as I am not aware that it has to be filed earlier and I am not familiar to the place. I asked the police to help me and visited the site because the Engineer on site started to threaten me. The conversation didnxe2x80x99t go well when I made a phone call at around 12:30nn xe2x80x93 1:30pm if I remember correctly because it was after my class along Recto. I asked him, why I donxe2x80x99t hear anything from them and they donxe2x80x99t care the urgency of the situation. He told me, xe2x80x9cMonday pa lang po at nasa meeting po ako kaya di ako makareply. Wala pa po yun boss, i-update ko po kayo at sigurado po na mag-uusap kayo within this week kasi busy pa po sa Bicol. xe2x80x9c I told him, how long I will wait when I had my number with him and should he be the one to call me if he cannot decide on the matter?? How can I put my mind at ease when hexe2x80x99s always waiting for his boss to come in Manila and he just keeps delaying the situation and he refused giving the Companyxe2x80x99s information? Then, he told mexe2x80xa6.xe2x80x9dmaxe2x80x99am busy lang po talaga at baka nakakalimutan nyo po na may pananagutan din kayo sa tao namin bilang driver, puede ko nga po kayong ipa-blotter. Di nyu nga po dinala sa ospital yun taoxe2x80x9dxe2x80xa6 He brought back the topic regarding the hospital issue confidently but he never realized how negligent and irresponsible he was. I told him, hexe2x80x99s free to report the incident and hexe2x80x99s now threatening me so we will know who violated the rules and as I have mentioned it would be better if our counsels will do the talking since we are both trying to prove innocence of both parties but he ended the conversation that he will send me the updates on how they will settle the broken side mirror.   They did not coordinate with me since March 09 of 2015.  The police visited the site to investigate but the Foreman said to the officer that we are in the process of coordinating the issue and after the police left the site, the Engineer send me a text as attached dated March 09 2015 but that was the last information I got from them. I asked the police officer for the report and picked up the following day March 10, 2015 and forwarded to the Insurance Company supposedly the contractors responsibility.  I am attaching pictures and other documents that you might need for investigation. I want to teach them a lesson for their negligence and lack of safety devices that will harm the workers, by-passers, and motorists as well.   Hope to hear from you.

CFMC-20150589," Honorable Rogelio L. Singson Secretary DPWH  Thru:	The Regional Director  	DPWH-Region III 	San Fernando, Pampanga   Dear Sir:  I am an employee of this department and I am also a concerned citizen wherein a very traumatic experienced had happen to us during our return back to Manila from the Province in Lamut, Ifugao.  Last April 12, 2015 at around 2:00 AM we were halted near a police station before the city proper of San Jose City because of the ongoing road construction on that area. The traffic situation on the area was observed to be heavy and that kilometres of motorist were already piling-up until such a traffic aide advice light vehicular motorist to divert to a local road wherein telling us that itxe2x80x99s a short cut to reach San Jose City. Traversing more or less 700M  there was a temporary signage made of plywood an arrow left and markings of  xe2x80x9cTO SAN JOSE CITYxe2x80x9d. Traversing again around 300m more or less an arrow left sign again, until we reach a certain rough road and there was a traffic aide letting us cross a xe2x80x9cbox culvertxe2x80x9d in an irrigation canal then a concrete road, after around 200m there was a junction, an unnoticeable gravel road and the continuity of the concrete road. The motorist ahead of us followed the concrete road and we also followed. Traversing a combination of concrete and gravel road until we observed that we are already climbing a newly graded gravel road. I am already apprehensive because the terrain becomes winding and   seeing lights downhill believed to be San Jose City proper. Back of my mind reasons, that we were on the right track because of the effort that it was recently graded for the convenience of the motorist rerouting.  Until we are halted because motorist ahead of us stop. Thought it was due to traffic again. But I was already alighted because why we are in the middle of nowhere and in a roadway on a mountain side. We already wonder why it took so long that the motorist ahead us moves, until we received relayed messages of drivers ahead of us that no more road to traverse, that it was a dead end.  This time, I panicked, I was nervous, cold feel creep on my nerves, I rattled because of the thought that we were lost in the middle of nowhere and that it is almost 4:00 AM. What about if there were nice people around that might notice we were lost and that the thought of bad things might happened. Until we decided to turn around.    If only there were enough traffic signages and traffic aide in every junction of the road to guide motorist especially it was dark not even street lights to guide us. It was a horrible and traumatic experienced and even me an employee of DPWH had to undergo these very traumatic experienced because of insufficient and lowly traffic management. I know even those who experienced the same fate that we have might curse the people who were responsible of what they have undergone/suffered.  I hope this could be an eye opener that traffic management is very important in a road construction notwithstanding that there is a pay item on this on the Program of Works.

Holes were bored to the road which was seemingly layered with asphalt. Being road users and concerned citizens, we would like to inquire and be shed light on the process of determining if the road section already need repair. This is also on the background that we have seen a number of road sections in Bukidnon that really needs repair yet repairs are not yet scheduled for this.   Thank you for your assistance.

PAHATI Construction) In connection with the on-going implementation of the above-subject Project, we would like to bring to your attention the following issues/concerns/complaints in behalf of our community in Camella Homes 5: 1.0 Along the 200-m stretch of Naga Road (from entrance of Dna Julita Subd to the bridge site) which has been dug and installed with new drainage pipes and manholes by R. PAHATI CONSTRUCTION, there is no regular Traffic Management Officer assigned to manage and direct the daily flow of traffic. Likewise, the installed safety barricades/provisions are dangerously inadequate so much so that said stretch of road construction is virtually xe2x80x9can accident waiting to happenxe2x80x9d. 2.0 Inadequate installation of visible and informative road signage along Naga Road and in nearby affected roads. Such signs should clearly inform all commuters/affected stakeholders where to enter or pass and if possible, the time/day/period where such restrictions will be in effect; 3.0 Contractorxe2x80x99s negligent work practices in breaking road pavement and excavating the roadway where the drains will be installed has resulted to at least three incidents of Maynilad Water supply mains being busted; 4.0 Information, Education and Communication (IEC) efforts to inform residents of Camella Homes 5 HOA, Dna Paz HOA, Dna Julita HOA, and nearby HOA/communities of the impacts to traffic and pedestrian/vehicle access of the construction activities related to the Project should be extended to all HOA around or near the project site. A public briefing for affected communities could be made soonest at a venue near the project site like in Camella Homes 5 or Vergon Ville covered gym for this matter. (OVER) 5.0 Contractorxe2x80x99s incorrect installation of drainage mains in at least 2 locations (actually observed along Naga Road in front of Camella 5 subdivision) where the existing Maynilad Water supply main line was made to directly intersect and pierce through the concrete drain pipe instead of the Maynilad Water line passing under or over the drainage pipe. This practice is blatant violation of best engineering practice and construction standards. 6.0 The wrong construction method for installation of drainage pipe that allows Maynilad Water supply main to ""pierce"" the concrete pipe - a violation of construction specs & methods for utilities. It is kindly requested that your soonest attention and appropriate measures be effected to resolve issues and problems that persists in the project site. Truly yours, By: ARNOLD P.

CFMC-20160565,"  Hi! I just would like to complaint about 2 things, first is the regarding the lights along the EDSA-Ayala Tunnel and same with EDSA-Shaw tunnel. I have noticed that ever since the EDSA-Ayala tunnel was completed, it did not have sufficient lighting inside the tunnel. Same goes with the EDSA-Shaw tunnel, which according to MMDA lights are only turned on during night time. We all know that road safety is everyones top priority. But in this case I dont think we are putting it on top of our list. Tunnels are really dark in reality, daylight will be very impossible to enter it. Thats why we need to install ample lights inside. Motorists should be able to have clear vision inside the tunnel. And should not be required to open their respective head and tail lights. Please install ample lighting in both tunnels since it has been dark for a long time already. For the safety of the motorists passing the tunnel everyday. Secondly, I have noticed that the Philippines has no standard traffic law or traffic signs being used. Why cant we have just one standard law that can be easily understood by the motorist. So everyone is guided by that law. Signages play an important role in the countries traffic system. If we have uniformity in our signages, motorist can easily identify the road rules and regulations. Local Government should follow DPWH laws and not have their own. This adds to the confusion of the motorist. If we have different ordinances in every city. All of us should just use and follow one system. Let me know how I can be of help in solving the long problem of our country. And that is our traffic system. You may contact me thru my mobile phone or e-mail. Thanks and hope to hera from you soon!""",5/31/2016 13:38,4,8

We are on the problem in passing these rough portions of the road especially when transporting our farm products to the market. Some senior citizens living in this area wanted to go the church could go to because of the difficulty to travel on the rough portion of our road. Concreting of these portions of the road is the only solution. With regards to these problem, can you help us for funding on the concreting work for the above farm to market road?

Dont wait that one of this kids will have a tragic accident crossing that river everyday! Make some action now before its too late!!!  FB LINK:  https://www.facebook.com/becomingfilipino/videos/1592929764305556/  For a lot of Filipinos education is important. In fact it is so important that they will go to great lengths just to get to school...  I stayed over at my friends place in Mamabuaya, Cagayan de Oro, and proceeded to go on a morning trek down to the riverside in the neighbouring Brgy. Bayagna. What did I find there?  18 kids (ages 5-14) on their way to school...  This is a raw look at their journey...  Turns out none of the young kids have raincoats and none of the older kids have ""payungs"" (Umbrellas). Even if it rains they still take the epic journey to school and try to change into drier clothes after crossing the river.  Hearing this...  I spent all day today creating 18 ""rain packs!"" One for each kid!   What was in them: - A thick plastic to waterproof - A waterproof lunch box - A fresh big towel (to dry and change with) - Lots of little ""baon"" goodies - Mirror, Comb, soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste (so the kids can look pogi for school... They were all bathing in the river when I first met them this morning) - The young kids now have rain coats. The older kids have payungs. - School kits for each kid (paper, pen, pencil, markers, sharpener) - 100 peso for each kid to purchase whatever makes them happy  One day at a time, One school journey at a time... #BecomingFilipino  Super Apir to these kids!!  *** I didn	 film much interaction and much of the distribution of packs. Those were moments that I really just wanted my barkada camerman and I to really experience individually. It was really beautiful to see the kids shocked that I was there handing them packages after seeing me in the morning, and then really show appreciation and excitement",6/23/2015 8:25,5,14

CFMC-20151096,"  Please be informed that the construction of the Mendiola bridge at Siocon River, Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte has been delayed for quite sometime. The contractor - Vicente T. Lao Construction (VTLC) has not made any substantial progress since they started the project during the last quarter 2014. From November 2014 until May this year, the Siocon River had very shallow waters due to the occurrence of drought, which would have been the right time for the contractor to fast-track the project. But for a long time, they managed to construct only a platform for their crane, which at this time, serves as a choke point of the swollen flood waters of the Siocon River. The platform, now constructed halfway of the rivers width, acts as an obstruction to the free flow of water, which would cause a backflow, overflow the riverbank, and eventually inundate several low-lying barangays. For this reason, this representation - the designated MDRRMO of Siocon - earnestly request intervention of DPWH to direct the contractor for the immediate deconstruction of the dam-platform to prevent potential disastrous flooding of the municipality. We will be submitting a report to DPWH Regional Office, cc: Office of the Honorable Secretary. Thank you.""",7/7/2015 8:21,5,14

SKYWAY STAGE 3 Dear Secretary Singson, It is laudable for government to serve the needs of the people. Commuters have been suffering from heavy traffic especially during rush hours and also during the months of November to December. But it seems that heavy traffic within Metro Manila is now an all year round occurrence. Our streets are not expanding but our population and vehicles on the road are growing yearly. The project of your department to link the SLEX and NLEX is a very good undertaking and our company fully supports it since we use both toll ways to reach to our client-schools. Last year when several DPWH surveyors marked the site of where to place the posts or supports of the Skyway Stage 3, particularly posts PS3-64 and PS3-65, these posts are marked directly in front of our office lobby and main warehouse garage. As the Skyway Stage 3 project will obstruct our building along G. Araneta Ave it will also obstruct the normal flow of our business. May we then request that the mentioned posts be moved or adjusted in a way it will not impede our normal business operations? We are hopeful for your favorable reply. Thank you very much. JORGE A.

The bridge on the right was completed 2 years ago but until now, hindi pa nadadaanan ng sasakyan. Kaya nga nagpatayo ng bagong tulay kasi yong luma ay may edad na at hindi na safe daanan.

My concern is about the quality of the beams the construction company is making. They appear crooked and inferior. I am able to see them while driving at the road and the beams were being made by the workers at the road which exacerbates the traffic and poses danger to pedestrians. Now they have placed tarpaulins to hide them but I can see workers putting cement plasters to hide imperfections.

CFMC-20150339,"  To the Secretary DPWH, Dear Sir, Im Renato P. Sy Jr., 51 years old, married with 3 kids aged 23, 16 and 9. Im an OFW, seaman by profession. Im at sea for 30 long years and now tired of being away to my family. Im planning to retire in a couple of years. Hope you understand what i mean. Im an owner of two (2) adjacent lots with TCT 116577 and TCT 117138 (5000 M2, now less because of Eco Tourism Road)in Barangay Ibabang Talim, Lucena City, Quezon. At the back of my lot was a creek and a river which is now being quaried. Due to ongoing construction of Eco Tourism Road bridge my lot have been submerged by about 5 meters. This 2 lots were very important to me because this is where i plan my livelihood when i retire in a couple of years. Unfortunately these lots WILL NOT HAVE ANY VALUE BECAUSE IT WAS SUBMERGED BY ABOUT 5 METERS OR MORE ONCE THE BRIDGE ROAD IS FINISHED. I have pictures to prove this. I really concerned about the flooding that always happened in our country and the world due to climate change. Im a living witness to that when typhoon Frank brought flood in that area. Please help me. I hope the goverment will do something about this. Hope this complain will not fall into debt ears. I do believe with Daang Matuwid of the goverment but i also need your assistance into this matter. I do not have the money or resources to level my lot to the bridge. My lot will be a catch basin once the creek and river will overflow. IT IS AT THE CORNER OF FARM TO MARKET ROAD AND ECO TOURISM BRIDGE. Hoping for your favourable reply which is forthcoming. Renato P. Sy Jr.   4-24-15 Dear Sir,   Thanks very much for your reply. However gusto ko lang po na malaman kung ano ang plano ng DPWH sa Barangay road. Patataasin po ba ninyo para habulin ang taas ng approach sa tulay or lalagyan nalang ng ""underpass"" para hindi maharangan ang Barangay road sa crossing. Ano din ho ang hakbang para sa anti flood measures.   Respectfully yours,   Renato P. Sy Jr.  5-19-15 Dear Sir/s  This is a follow up of my previous inquiry of what plan the DPWH is working  with regards to the Barangay Road in Barangay Ibabang Talim which bisects the Morong Bridge Eco Tourism Road in Lucena.  Also attached herewith is a Petition letter executed and signed by some of the locals in Barangay Ibabang Talim, Lucena City. We have made this letter to show our concern with this project. Hope that you will look into the matter seriously.   Sincerely yours,  Renato P. Sy Jr.   6-3-15 Dear Sir,  Thanks for the reply. Frankly speaking im not agreeable to this project (uplifting of Ibabang Talim Barangay Road). Underpass for me is the best way to have a safe access in  the Barangay road. Small vehicles motorized/mechanical, bicycle, children, elderly and even farm animals from Barangay Ibabang Talim, BarangaySalinas, Barangay Ransohan, Barangay Ilayang Talim and other adjacent rural Barangays  will use this Underpass as a safest access. I have mentioned it from my previous messages the reasons that we are pointing why we are against the uplifting of Barangay road crossing Morong Bridge.  Yes i have a dialogue with the Project Engineer last March 4 but i did not agree to his proposal. In fact on that same day i have sent my 1st message on the ""Complaint/Feedback form of DPWH.   They have started pouring stones on the said intersection and we can	 do anything right now. As a matter of fact some residents are now restless and loosing hope. Yes we know that this is a goverment project and its very hard to oppose especially for the rural people/us.  Sir, Im leaving the country tonight June 3 to join my ship in Romania and may not always monitor my emails due to limited internet access on the vessel. I will give you the email address of the ship once im onboard so that you can update me about this matter.The best thing i hope is for this project to address all the needs of the people in the area.  Im expecting all the support the DPWH will extend to me/us so that my lot will not be a catch basin of flood waters and to have good ,safe access to it as well. I hope that despite what happens my lot will still be productive when i retire and not completely loose its value. Im now leaving with these words...

In behalf of my kabarangays, I would just like to voice out our frustration regarding the collapsed portion of the arnedo dike here in san vicente, apalit, pampanga, which gave way on 14 july 2014. The contractor who was tasked to do repairs on the said dike proved to be a negligent one, as he allowed the dike to be eroded. Worse, when the dike collapsed, he and his men were nowhere to be found. As of this writing, the river is still threatening to overflow and submerge our localitys estimated 400 families, as only a few sandbags remain as our defense from the rampaging waters of the mighty pampanga river. What makes matters worse is the inevitability of the coming of the rainy season, as repairs will surely take some material time to be made. In this regard, we are imploring your good office to initiate the necessary repairs of the collapsed portion of the arnedo dike, if only to dissuage the fears of the people of san vicente of an impending catastrophe.

Please refer his complaint to the right department for corrective action. Thanks and regards... Gilbert From: Mike Jose <donpmj@yahoo.com>; To: jose gilbert <gilbertjose@yahoo.com>; Cc: Jose Carlo <cmfjose@gmail.com>; Subject: Contractor made flooding Sent: Sat, May 30, 2015 1:50:20 PM Dear Sec Singson, I am writing your good office to complain about the carelessness and insensitivity of a contractor doing drainage improvement work on Gen Luna near the corner of Padre Faura Ermita manila. There was a thunderstorm on May 30, 2015 in our area at around 9pm lasting for more than 30 minutes. This caused flooding in front of our house and even caused water to enter our garage which has never happened in the last 38 years of our stay in the area. The contractor FLORDES CONSTRUCTION AND TRADIMG CORP excavated Gen Luna St dumping all the soil at the side of the road covering all the storm drains and gutters thus preventing the free flow of water. The soil created a dam in front of our house thus this problem of flooding and water entering our garage. It seems they failed to notice Gen Lunas elevation is higher from the corner of UN Avenue and rain water goes down towards Padre Faura and on to Taft Avenue. Also the street level is already higher than our sidewalk therefore the tendency of water to go to side of the road where the gutters and sidewalks are. We have never had water logged like this in front of our house in the 38 years that My wife and have lived here. Not even Ondoy did this to us. Its only during the night of May 30, 2015 that this occurred due to the carelessness of the contractor Involved. In fact water had entered our garage and as of 930pm last night it was 5inches away from having water coming into our home on the ground floor level. Good thing the rains stopped preventing water from entering our ground floor level. Sad to say I talked to the foreman of the contractor in the morning of May 30th and told him about our concern and the possibility of this happening but I was told that the excess soil will be hauled away during the day. Well apparently they did not do so. my wife and I had to clean out the sidewalk and the inside of our garage of mud and water in the morning of May 31st. Two senior citizens having to do this all because someone did not pay attention and failed to consider the implications of their actions. We would appreciate if the proper department could be informed of this situation and if the contractor can be given instructions to correct the situation immediately and for them to avoid dumping soil in front of our house to prevent another occurrence of this problem. As long as the excess soil from the excavation remains there, the threat of flood water entering our garage and home will be there. Please inform FLORDES CONSTRCTUON that we are senior citizens in the household and at the same time I am also a PWD and this situation is stressing us out for as long as the gutters and storm drains are clogged up with soil. The soil MUST BE REMOVED AND THE STORM DRAINS AND GUTTERS CLEANED UP IMMEDIATELY to prevent another flooding of our garage and possibly our home. Thank you for your kind attention.

CFMC-20160068,"  14 January 2016   The Secretary Department of Public Works and Highways  Dear Sir: This letter concerns a matter of extreme urgency. I am writing to ask your office to look into the project of Congressman Dan Fernandez of the First District of Laguna (who is also planning to run for the position of Mayor of the City of Santa Rosa, Laguna)and to put a halt to it until further investigations and safety checks have been carried out. Mr. Fernandez has embarked on a project to construct a concrete wall on the south riverbank of the Silang-Santa Rosa River, which puts the residents on the riverside at risk of severe flooding and potential collapse and destruction of their houses. This project was planned without consultation with the residents of this city, and construction has been going on for the last month. It was temporarily halted when the river flooded and overflowed on December 19, 2015, and the scaffolding that had already been built for the construction of the wall collapsed and was damaged. Work on the project resumed last week. From the construction workers remarks and seeing the current scaffolding, the height of this planned wall will be higher than the height of the original south riverbank: this, in effect, cuts the width of the river by at least 30% and narrows it considerably. In the event of heavy rain or another typhoon, the volume of water that gets dumped into this river becomes enormous. With the width of the river reduced by 1/3 following construction of the south riverbank concrete wall, the potential for this project to make matters worse has been more than compounded. In the light of the severe flooding throughout the city that happened most recently when the river overflowed above the south riverbank on December 19, 2015,we can foresee that this project will cause the water level to rise above the original riverbankxe2x80x99s height and lead to foreseeable damage and destruction of the homes bordering the north riverbank, and flooding of the roads, especially Gov. Feliciano Gomez St (which parallels the river) and Arambulo and Anonuevo streets (which are perpendicular to Gov. F. Gomez Street). When the flood water level in the river rises above the riverbank and batters the walls of the homes built along the north riverbank, these houses walls will eventually collapse. In our case, the bedroom where my bedridden parents lodge (aged 89 years and 93 years, and incapacitated by multiple strokes) is located right beside the riverbank on the north side. If the floodwaters rise, the water will overflow above the window of their bedroom and flood the bedroom. Evacuating them to a safer place in time of this foreseeable emergency is going to prove to be a challenge for their 2 caregivers. We foresee that the whole house will be inundated with floodwaters following completion of this concrete wall on the opposite side of the river. Our house is sturdily built and has stood on the same site since 1966. Our grandmothers ancestral house was built by our grandfather in 1935 and has withstood 8 decades of typhoons without suffering any damage. They are at high risk of being destroyed as a consequence of Mr. Fernandezs inadequately researched public project. The other homes along the riverbank which lie west and east of our parents and grandparents homes are constructed of more flimsy materials and are much smaller, and bound to take a much harder hit and be more easily damaged or destroyed. Mr. Fernandez newly constructed ""house""/campaign headquarters lies on the other side of Gov. Feliciano Gomez Street further east, and is constructed on higher ground with high concrete walls, and is unlikely to be at risk of flooding, unlike ours and our neighbors houses. While the reasoning behind this project may have been well-meaning and well-intentioned, the fact remains that this project has been undertaken without the necessary engineering assessments (or maybe, or with utter disregard for them). Construction is currently continuing. There have not been any public announcements nor discussion regarding this project, and no attempt to liaise and inform the residents of the extent and potential consequences of this project have been made. Because of the imminent danger and considerable damage to person and property it threatens to bring, we are therefore asking you to look into this matter urgently and halt construction until a public forum and investigation have been carried out.   Very truly yours,   Dr. Melissa Jeanne P. Batilando  Engr. Emiliano Joel P. Batilando, Jr.  Engr. Jose Melvyn Glenn P. Batilando   On behalf of our parents:   Emiliano R. Batilando, Sr.  Gliceria P.

CFMC-20160552,"  I am a resident of Talayan Village. I see that construction of EEI for the Skyway Stage 3 is ongoing and in full swing along Araneta Ave. I would like to know what you plan to do about flood control as flood level in our area is really really bad. A number of people died during Ondoy (2009) and Habagat (2012/2013) and this is not a light matter, not a joking matter at all. We are located in one of the more elevated areas in the village but the water level during Ondoy was up to the roof. Our family driver drowned (and died). We lost our home (we were not able to live in it after Ondoy). I cannot explain it enough. Because of your construction the normal water level in Araneta creek has risen. I have been a resident of Talayan Village since the 80s. Please, we beg you, not to worsen the flood situation. Hold off construction until you alleviate flood concerns, widening of waterways, etc. I looked it up and this project is worth 20+ billion pesos. I dont think it is too much to ask to include the safety of the people that will be affected by your construction. The hassle and dirt of your construction we could live with as long as your project will not aggravate the flood situation. Whenever it rains, I almost cant sleep because of worry. Please do not aggravate the situation we have to live with. Although as I stated earlier, you already have. Just one poste built along Araneta Avenue between Maria Clara and Quezon Ave and the water level of Araneta Creek already rose. How many more postes are you going to build?!?!?! I am really scared. Your response will be greatly appreciated. I hope to receive concrete answers not just vague, sweeping statements of assurance that will in no way alleviate our concerns.

CFMC-20150313,"  I am a resident of Tanauan, Leyte, Eastern Visayas/Region VIII. We would like to request that our 6 meter national highway bridge in Solano, Tanauan, Leyte, be repaired at the earliest time as it has been almost one and a half years since it was destroyed by the Super Typhoon Yolanda. At the moment, alternate route is being used by residents of Tanauan and the nearby towns Dagami and Burauen. This route is through the Tanauan market using the almost more than 50-year old Embarkadero bridge, and the ""newer"" bridges along the diversion road of Tanauan, Leyte. As the Embarkadero bridge is almost older than us, we fear that what happened to Hiagsam bridge in Jaro, Leyte could happen to our Embarcadero bridge considering the additional load, of all commuters and vehicles small and heavy ones alike, it is subjected to since after the Yolanda destruction. We believe Embarkadero bridge is also even overdue for check up and maintenance repair. I reckon DPWH is also concerned of depreciation of its infrastructures. We witnessed that there had been work started on the repair of the Solano bridge but it seemed to have been abandoned long before its set completion date of February 20, 2015. There are materials such as hardened cement, steel bars and boulders left at the site. There are already rumors bordering on SOP and corrupt officials concerned on the repair of said bridge. I, however, choose to still count on the honest and concerned service of DPWH, all its officials and employees. It is with this fervent hope that we pray to see that this request merits your prompt and able action as we were informed the request for budget is already at the DPWH Central Office. More power and God bless!!! Sincerely, SEGUNDINA DEVOTA A. DILAO, RND",3/3/2015 9:45,5,24

Singson: Greetings to our good Secretary of DPWH we ever had in recent decades ! This has reference to the recently completed road widening of Sgt. Esguerra St. in South Triangle,(passing ABS-CBN station area and my condo residence), in Diliman, Quezon City, with some deficiencies and lacking road standards: a)drainage outlets lacking screen/strainer to prevent garbage entering canals, which will be filled-up with debris later since these are not regularly opened and cleaned (also in many drainage canals in metro manila due to their designs. DPWH should consider Malaysian-designed drainage of open rectangular canals covered with folding steel bars for easy cleaning and spotting of water flows/blocking (rather than the current covered culverts). b)road sidewalks for pedestrians are absent in front of certain business establishments (or slanted sidewalk not suited to sidewalk passers but for car parking xe2x80x93 not consistent to universal standards as seen abroad); and not continuous due to failure to remove the sidewalk-roadblock (presence of carenderia) near the Megaworld condo building. Please request your concerned district engineer to remedy the above matters. Thank you. Sincerely Prof. Rogelio V. Paglomutan UST Faculty 38 Sgt.

While the Apayao part has been cemented, THIS PARTICULAR stretch on the CAGAYAN portion has been forgotten and neglected for as long as this road has been established. This is impacting the residents of Flora, ta. Marcela, Apayao and Ayaga, Cagayan. This has a tremendous pabigat to everyone because this is the only exit and entry road to and out of Flora and Sta Marcela where hundreds of students have to pass through in order to get to their colleges and schools, and to the merchants and in general the local economy. Rumurs have it that the Gov. Bulut, Jr. of Apayao even offered to the Governor of Cagayan that they complete this as a oint project. However, I firmly and strongly believe, this rad is UNDER your jusrisdiction. THIS particular road should be a priority, and we do not understtand why it hasnt been. Please look at the pictures on the link before this message. This road is almost unpassable during the rainy seasons.

CFMC-20150437,"  Sir/Madam, Let me once again call your attention regarding this matter. The last reply dated January 27 from your District Engineer says: ""After effecting the proper and appropriate coordination with the City Government, the Contractor has already resumed the project implementation and shall complete the project within this month."" Today is March 21 and I want to show you the development of your project. Please see attached files named ""Picture 1 Before"" and Picture 1 Now"" also the files ""Picture 2 Before"" and ""Picture 2 Now"". You can see that there was no development in your project. How can you ""complete the project within this month"", as you claimed? My observation about your project is that, there are numerous projects being implemented in the City of Iloilo simultaneously and you awarded the contract to only certain contractor WITHOUT CHECKING IF THIS CONTRACTOR IS CAPABLE WITH MANPOWER to do the job. You can not see any worker at daytime working in this project, they only comes at night, few of them, and work for short hours then leave. They will come back again after 3 to 5 days to work again because the contractor is pulling them out to work on another project in the city. ""Picture 3"" shows the status of their work 4 days ago...nothing happened after that. I wonder if the district engineer is also checking their work. Does DPWH impose fines to contractor who failed to complete the project on time? surely they have Surety bond before they start the project. We, the taxpayers, are paying for this project cost. The project started FEBRUARY 2014 with a Contract Completion of 60 days and now its OVER ONE (1) YEAR and still not finish. I hope you will do something NOW about this matter.

CFMC-20151001,"  I would like to report a damage caused by your project with details on below (found the data over the internet). During the works, your contractor Rizal Millex Asphalt Corp hit the Manila Water pipes connected to our meter and this caused our bill to incur incredible amount of usage. My mom coordinated with the brgy officials who in turn worked with your contractors Engr, a certain Benjie with cellphone numbers 09158983762 & 09055483289 and he initially gave out around php 4k to cover for the first bill but there were subsequent bills after that reflecting an incredulous amount (now at over php 19k which was due on May 23). Normally, our bills are only around php2k/month. Mom says our brgy chairman has been trying to contact Engr Benjie but he doesnt pick and refrain from meeting with us to settle the water bill caused by the damage his men did. Can you help us please because Manila Water only allows until July 3 to settle or they will disconnect the water supply?

CFMC-20151022,"  Dear DPWH: I would like to report the Drainage Project of Bulacan 2nd Engg District right in front of our driveway. Located at Km. 42 Sta. Maria - Norzagaray Road (Near Norzagaray Boundary Arc). This project was abandoned by the Contractor C&F CONSTRUCTION for almost 2-months now (Which reflects on the barricade). The pit is almost 5-6feet below the ground and stars to erode by the rain. This project is causing so much inconvenience to us when entering and leaving our house because half of our driveway was inaccessible. This also may cause danger to the motorist/pedestrians walking on the road specially during night since this pit was located in a curve road (Kurbada). We are hoping that you provide the appropriate action regarding this situation as soon as possible. **Attached is the photos of the abandoned project** -AJ Ignacio""",6/29/2015 12:01,6,25
