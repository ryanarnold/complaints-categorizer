They started with digging holes last 10 September 2015, Thursday using a heavy equipment then no one work last Friday and Saturday. They continue digging last Monday and Tuesday but started after lunch then no one work again yesterday. May I know what is this project? How come the work is staggered and starting after lunch only, I am wondering why so? What is the timeline of this project? They are suppose to work everyday and 8 hours a day right? So they can finish early and on time. It is really a hassle that they dug the street and it seems that there is no urgency to finish it. Please explain. And also kindly call the attention of the contractor to do their job diligently so we can have full access of the road soonest time possible. I am a taxpayer and I am entitled to know about this project. Kindly advise. Thank you very much. Rey'",

Several accidents have already happened in the past few weeks along these said barriers and as of today (April 27, 2016) another accident took place infront of the Iglesia ni Cristo - New Era University where a truck headed northward to Angeles City rampaged the concrete barrier and crossing head-on the opposite lane.(Pls see attached pictures) This is not the first time that such accident happened in this particular area. I am respectfully addressing this perilous situation to your good office for a possible immediate solution to the problem in order to avoid future fatal accidents.

Singson Kagawaran ng mga Pagawain at Lansangang Pambayan Port Area, Manila Mahal naming Kalihim Singson, Paki imbestigahan naman po ang harapang pagbabalewala at pagmamanipula ng mga taong nakapaligid sa inyo at sa inyong pagnanais na pagbabago sa DPWH. Marahil ay di nyo alam ang background ng taong ito na binigyan nyo ng Special Order para gawing OIC-ADE ng Pampanga 2nd Engineering District (S.O No. 75, S, 2015). Kaya heto po ang kamangha manghang tungkol sa kanya. 1. Siya po si NOMER ABEL P. CANLAS, dating radio operator ng Pampanga Sub-district Engineering Office noong District Engineer pa si USEC Rafael Yabut. Naging Administrative Officer ng Pampanga 1st District Engineering Office kapalit noon ni Ador Canlas na noo\\xe2\\x80\\x99y naging Assistant District Engineer sa Tarlac. 2. Napaka giliw niyang empleyado lalo na sa mga Contractors noong nasa Pampanga 1st District Engineering Office pa siya dahil siya ang nagaayos sa mga ito tuwing may bidding at nangongolekta ng SOP. 3. Nag-aral ng Civil Engineering at nag graduate noong 2013 habang siya ang Administrative Officer ng Pampanga 1st District Office ng hindi man lang nag file ng leave of absence kahit minsan. Ito ay sa panahon ni yumaong D.E. Jose Datu at sinundan ni D.E. Enrico Guilas. Sana ay imbestigahan naman ng Civil Service Commission ang Leave Card nitong taong ito. 4. Kumuha ng C.E. board examination pagka graduate ng hindi man lang nagreview pero pumasa. Dahil sa pagbabayad ng P150,000.00. Kaya po isa siya sa mga produkto ng \\xe2\\x80\\x9cR.A. 150\\xe2\\x80\\x9d kung tawagin namin dito sa Pampanga dahil hindi naman sila karapatdapat na gawaran ng R.A 1080. 5. Nag test sa Promotional Exam noong 2014 pero marahil dahil di puedeng bayaran ang CSC ay hindi pumasa. Subalit na promote parin bilang Engr. IV sa UPMO, mula sa pagiging administrative officer, sa tulong syempre ni USEC at ni Kuyang USEC, ito ay loob ng wala pang isang (1) taon mula ng siya ay nag graduate sa Republic Central Colleges. Mukhang naisahan na naman po ang inyong patakaran. Ang gagaling po nila diba? 6. Matagal na po naming naririnig dito sa Region III ang plano nila USEC at Kuyang Usec na gagawin siyang District Engineer Kapalit ni OIC-DE Juanito Reguyal na magreretiro sa Agusto, at heto na nga po ang kanilang unang hakbang, napa pirma nila ang isang Special Order na ginagawa siyang OIC-ADE. Puede po ba iyon kahit di nya naipasa ang promotional exam?. Hindi po ba pagmamanipula na naman iyon sa mga polisiya ninyo tungo sa pagbabagong anyo ng DPWH? Paki aksyunan naman po agad ito at baka gawan nila ng paraan na gawin siyang Regional Director. Magiging kaawa-awa na naman ang DPWH pag nagkataon dahil halata naman na wala siyang kaalaman sa Civil Engineering profession dahil puro pagkakaperahan lamang ang laman ng kanyang isip. Kayo lamang po ang makakapigil sa pamamayagpag ng taong ito at ng kanyang mga Kuyang na sana po ay ngayon na. Mga sawa na sa katiwalian. CC: 1. The Ombudsman 2.

Rogelio L Singson Sir, It was in the year 2011 when the good secretary with much pride told the DPWH employees that He is giving twenty thousand pesos to the BEST performing office, Ten Thousand pesos to those who performed BETTER, 5 Thousand to those whose performance are considered GOOD and none to those who did not make it to the grades. GOOD - BETTER \\xe2\\x80\\x93 BEST. Parang PUSOY. The C N A incentive Bonus during that time was agreed upon by the union and management at 20k. The employees then would want the reward be given to them across the board since what we do here in this agency is a team effort and the grading of offices is too subjective that only those who are close to the powers that be might receive the awards. And so it went. Comes now the disallowance made by the COA, who usually has been a recipient of C N A incentive bonus before the term of Secretary Singson except in 2011 onwards. The disallowance was based on a DBM Circular providing a ceiling of 25k to C N A incentive bonus of employees which was made known to all agencies in September, 2011. This DBM rule is like changing rules in the middle of the game. The C N A incentive Bonus before September 2011 shall be based on the savings and the general provisions stating the priority in the use of savings of the GAA for the particular year. Suddenly the DBM ceiling. PUSOY TALAGA. Me panggugulang pa kasama! The irony of it all, the good secretary also requested that the usual 10k we receive from the office of the president every Christmas be slashed to 5 thousand so we can help the victims of calamities during that year. As far as I can remember it was the Typhoon Pablo that brought destruction to the people of the Southern Philippines. But the slashed Christmas Bonus became permanent. And now since 2011, we have a Christmas bonus reduced by half permanently. Then this secretary was claiming that he is very generous to the employees of the DPWH... Double jeoparfy. Our xmas bonus was reduced by 5k per year. And already 4 years hence. We were robbed of the Christmas bonus and still you want us to refund! Have the honourable Rogelio L. Singson any notion of the Net Take home pay of the DPWH employees? Did the secretary realize that most of the employees here are receiving less than six thousand pesos a month after deducting GSIS, Taxes and Loans from various financial institutions?'",

Hindi naman po sa minamadali kaso napapansin na din po ng mga tao dito na sobrang bagal ng mga gumagawa. Madalas e makikita mo silang nakatambay at nagke-kwentuhan. Kapansin-pansin po talaga ang kanilang kabagalan. Ang sasakyan po namin hindi na namin maiuwi since last year dahil sa road construction na ginagawa nila. Yung ibang mga nasementong kalsada pa po ay pachi-pachi ang gawa parang chessboard. May mga parte pa ng kalsada na hindi pa nasesementuhan. At dahil nag-uulan na nitong mga nakaraang araw, naiipunan ito ng tubig at nagdudulot ng baha. At nung nakaraan nga ay may nahulog na matandang babae dahil marupok ang ginawa nilang tulay na kahoy. Itinawag ko na din po ito sa inyong hotline at sinabi na isend ko din sa fb page ninyo para maipost ko ang mga picture. \n\nEto pong picture na ito ay intersection. Kung mapapansin ninyo ay halos hindi sya madaanan ng mga sasakyan. Yung isang side na galing at papuntang Elga street lang ang makakadaan.\n\nEto naman yung part na hindi pa nasesementuhan. Puno na ng tubig dahil sa ulan at hindi man lang ginawan ng daluyan ng tubig.\n\nEto yung isa lang parte na walang semento\n\nEto naman yung binuhusan nila ng semento pero nasira yung plywood na umaalalay sa ilalim. Hindi ko maintindihan kung dapat ba talagang may plywood since sesementuhan naman sya. Tatlong araw na nilang pinupukpok ng martilyo at pako yang semento. Kung mapapansin nyo ang dami nila nakapwesto dyan pero lamang ang kwentuhan nila\n\nSana po ay maaksyunan nyo ito.

The Teachers has to walk 3Km of muddy road because the contractor has to work in their other acquired concreting project also in the same locality lately.

This project started on February 12, 2014 with a working period of 60 days. On the start of the Project last February 2014, the contractor destroyed/broke the existing WORKING drainage here in Tanza Street, Iloilo City. 11 months after, December 2014, the drainage is not yet fixed. Per the attached pictures you can see that the drainage is NOT functioning at all since the start of your project. The water is stagnant and already GREEN...It is full of garbage...it is open and poses danger to the public since this area is very populated area and elementary schools are nearby...you can also see GRASSES growing around the open drainage. an interesting view since the surrounding areas are all concrete...For your immediate action.

It\\'s useless, bob already knows about your explanation.\n\n     You already told me a lot of things with the copy I sent. The evidence is with his hands. The matter of complaint was on the Red Tape. If you showed me a picture, it\\'s only a picture but I have a lengthy letter which you did not mention. It was not me who hindered this, right? To tell you frankly, you have made a big mistake. You are trying to insult me for my apparent lack of knowledge.\n     \n     Its top secret that it went off, is because you are afraid of Drilon and possibly will be said  against the DPWH head, Secretary Singson. Perhaps you are afraid that it may awaken some of the sentiments and construction shall drop in DPWH since you have been designated as the chief of the information division and feedback liaison officer in the DPWH.\n\n     One of the obligations of your office is to publicize the bidding process to all the people of Paquibato who won the \"Dire\" camp Gulones Km. 1-2 to 4 and km 7. How much construction cost which is supposedly in the 3 billion plus \"signage\". Why is  it that they will not mention how much was spent for one kilometer, one billion for Km 1-2 and for Km 4 it reached 1 billion. This was only 350 meters, well for km 7 I don\\'t know but the cemented part is only 500 plus. This shows that the project did not reach 2 km. I\\'m short of time, for now thank you'",

I am saying it severely since the project does not only took few weeks but almost more than a year already of heavy traffic, long walks of our children when going to school, dirt it caused in the area that are almost hazardous when commuting and so much more even in little things that makes your day in a bad mood. In addition, what annoys the people here is that the work of the project stopped from time to time causing delays due to changing of contractors which we heard due to budget issues.\nMy apologies if this mail was sent to all email address I found on your site since I am not sure who is the right person to approach but I found courage to do so when your contractor blocked the street corner going to our houses on which no means of transportation can enter and knowing today that it was stopped because there is no budget to continue the task. I know we need to sacrifice to make things better but knowing the situation, i think it is not fair to the people affected.\nI believed we are all professionals here and starting a project means that it has an estimated time of completion.

Dati kahit papano nadadaanan papo ung tulay kahit isang lane lang ngayon tinibag nila totally di na makadaan mga sasakyan. Humihina din ung mga pwesto sa palengke ksi hindi makadaan mga sasakyan. Alam po namin marami kayong line up projects pero para nalang po sa mga bata pakibigyan naman po ng pansin ung request po namin. Maraming salamat po god bless you smile emoticon'",

Ang tagal na pong ganito ang sitwasyon ng daan na ito. Hindi lang buwan kundi taon na ang bibilangin.\n\nPls take note also that there is only 1 road but two bridges. Funny eh. The bridge on the right was completed 2 years ago but until now, hindi pa nadadaanan ng sasakyan. Kaya nga nagpatayo ng bagong tulay kasi 'yong luma ay may edad na at hindi na safe daanan. Hintayin pa ba natin na may aksidente na mangyari at may mawalan ng buhay dyan before we take action???. The problem w/ your regional director puro photo ops ang ginagawa...laging nakangiti kung kasama ka, si Sen Drilon, si Presidente. I would like also to bring to your attention the portion of the highway from Iloilo to Kalibo...sa probinsya po ng Capiz, it is one of the worst highway sa buong isla ng Panay na nadadaanan ko. Madadaanan din ng bisita natin sa APEC. Nakakahiya kung ito ba ang klase ng highway na madadaanan nila.\n\nYour immediate action is really needed on this.

It was originally a provincial road as seen in old titles and map but turned to a barangay road now. It is a 500m road rehabilitation I think to replace the asphalt road here in Brgy Maturanoc, Guimba, Nueva Ecija. I have two concerns about the construction sir. It is only a barangay road now and its elevation is too high after the construction is done, another sir is that i don't see that putting sands on top of an asphalt before concreting will not affect its stability. I'll be glad to hear from you sir since i'm not familiar with engineering works especially road construction. Thank you very much sir. Good day again sir. An Engineer already showed up here a while ago and showed the plan for the road rehabilitation project here. Additional query sir, take note sir that the asphalt is already jack hammered and holes are made before they put sand on top of it. What we think is that it should be done only when the asphalt is for removal. The road is not in a flood prone area so i think there is no need to elevate the road too much cause it will just add to its instability. If that should be the case then we have to rehabilitate also our houses to get along with the new elevation of the road after the construction. Thank you again sir. Mga sir engineers sa good dpwh. ngayun po k-12 na curriculum hndi po yta sa primary education ang need dagdagan. bka dapat po sa college na 2lad ng engineering. di po ba dapat pag aralan muna magiging epekto sa mga tao nung gagawing project. nagkaroon po muna sana ng feasibility study o kinausap man lng mga concern citizen na taxpayer kung ok po ba ung isasagawa. gustong gusto naming gumanda daan mga ginagalang na engineer pero bka po pwd pasyalan nyo ngayun ung naumpisahan na at kung ok po sa inyo o mga engineer d2 at maipaliwanag ang magandang epekto sa amin eh wala na po kami masasabi.\"",

His place never gets flooded but because a contractor digging in the area dumped all the soil from the project near his place which covered their drainage. The front of his house is now flooded. Please refer his complaint to the right department for corrective action. Thanks and regards... Gilbert From: Mike Jose <donpmj@yahoo.com>; To: jose gilbert <gilbertjose@yahoo.com>; Cc: Jose Carlo <cmfjose@gmail.com>; Subject: Contractor made flooding Sent: Sat, May 30, 2015 1:50:20 PM Dear Sec Singson, I am writing your good office to complain about the carelessness and insensitivity of a contractor doing drainage improvement work on Gen Luna near the corner of Padre Faura Ermita manila. There was a thunderstorm on May 30, 2015 in our area at around 9pm lasting for more than 30 minutes. This caused flooding in front of our house and even caused water to enter our garage which has never happened in the last 38 years of our stay in the area. The contractor FLORDES CONSTRUCTION AND TRADIMG CORP excavated Gen Luna St dumping all the soil at the side of the road covering all the storm drains and gutters thus preventing the free flow of water. The soil created a dam in front of our house thus this problem of flooding and water entering our garage. It seems they failed to notice Gen Luna's elevation is higher from the corner of UN Avenue and rain water goes down towards Padre Faura and on to Taft Avenue. Also the street level is already higher than our sidewalk therefore the tendency of water to go to side of the road where the gutters and sidewalks are. We have never had water logged like this in front of our house in the 38 years that My wife and have lived here. Not even Ondoy did this to us. It's only during the night of May 30, 2015 that this occurred due to the carelessness of the contractor Involved. In fact water had entered our garage and as of 930pm last night it was 5inches away from having water coming into our home on the ground floor level. Good thing the rains stopped preventing water from entering our ground floor level. Sad to say I talked to the foreman of the contractor in the morning of May 30th and told him about our concern and the possibility of this happening but I was told that the excess soil will be hauled away during the day. Well apparently they did not do so. my wife and I had to clean out the sidewalk and the inside of our garage of mud and water in the morning of May 31st. Two senior citizens having to do this all because someone did not pay attention and failed to consider the implications of their actions. We would appreciate if the proper department could be informed of this situation and if the contractor can be given instructions to correct the situation immediately and for them to avoid dumping soil in front of our house to prevent another occurrence of this problem. As long as the excess soil from the excavation remains there, the threat of flood water entering our garage and home will be there. Please inform FLORDES CONSTRCTUON that we are senior citizens in the household and at the same time I am also a PWD and this situation is stressing us out for as long as the gutters and storm drains are clogged up with soil. The soil MUST BE REMOVED AND THE STORM DRAINS AND GUTTERS CLEANED UP IMMEDIATELY to prevent another flooding of our garage and possibly our home. Thank you for your kind attention. Mike Jose \\t \n\nNote: (CPAR FORM USED)\"",

San Vicente and Brgy. Calendola here in the City of San Pedro, Laguna. This is in order for us to determine the actual load limit/allowable load limit of the said bridge. The said bridge had undergone repairs on the previous months of this year. After the repair we had asked for the load limit specifications in order for us to limit passage of Buses and big cargo trucks and to avoid over loading thereby causing damage in the future. But up to this date there was no official communication  from concerned government agency that will address this concern. We are also in constant communication with the Office of the City Engineer of San Pedro but they cannot provide us with the needed information. They are also waiting response from your office.\n\nLet me just brief you of the Geographical location of the said bridge. This is strategically locate as the entry and exit points of the upper barangays of the City of San Pedro, the Province of Cavite passing thru the town of General Mariano Alvarez and an alternate road going to Daang Hari. Any damage that will occur in the future will greatly affect mobilization of the populace passing thru San Vicente/Calendola Bridge.\n\nOnce again in behalf of the people of Barangay Calendola and other concerned motorists and commuters catered by this bridge, May I personally ask for your immediate assistance in addressing this urgent concern.\n\nMore power and GOD Bless,\n\n\nHON.

I see that construction of EEI for the Skyway Stage 3 is ongoing and in full swing along Araneta Ave. I would like to know what you plan to do about flood control as flood level in our area is really really bad. A number of people died during Ondoy (2009) and Habagat (2012/2013) and this is not a light matter, not a joking matter at all. We are located in one of the more elevated areas in the village but the water level during Ondoy was up to the roof. Our family driver drowned (and died). We lost our home (we were not able to live in it after Ondoy). I cannot explain it enough. Because of your construction the 'normal' water level in Araneta creek has risen. I have been a resident of Talayan Village since the 80s. Please, we beg you, not to worsen the flood situation. Hold off construction until you alleviate flood concerns, widening of waterways, etc. I looked it up and this project is worth 20+ billion pesos. I don't think it is too much to ask to include the safety of the people that will be affected by your construction. The hassle and dirt of your construction we could live with as long as your project will not aggravate the flood situation. Whenever it rains, I almost can't sleep because of worry. Please do not aggravate the situation we have to live with. Although as I stated earlier, you already have. Just one 'poste' built along Araneta Avenue between Maria Clara and Quezon Ave and the water level of Araneta Creek already rose. How many more 'postes' are you going to build?!?!?! I am really scared. Your response will be greatly appreciated. I hope to receive concrete answers not just vague, sweeping statements of assurance that will in no way alleviate our concerns. Thank you.\"",

Sad to report as a concern citizen that the usual travel of 9 hours from Manila to Ifugao is taking us now almost 18 to 22 hours just because of a very simple re-blocking project of the DPWH from Sta Fe to San Jose. Many Foreigners and some local tourists including me from Banaue and Sagada who missed their international and local flights were so angry because no one from the ground even the policemen passing cannot provide information what is happening with the traffic menace. Drivers from either lane to manila and to the north to Viscaya, Quirino, Isabela, Cagayan, Aparri, Kalinga, Mountain Province and Ifugao are shouting to the foreigners IT IS MORE FUN IN THE PHILIPPINES. MABUHAY ANG DAANG MATUWID!!! With these remarks of disgust from the public, I was so ashamed as a Civil Engineer like you are and this prompted me to search for the DPWH grievance redress mechanism hotline from your website but found your email ad. This are my concerns: i) the traffic everyday at that section if not given attention immediately is next to economic sabotage. The cost of missed flights, office hours, goods undelivered is already enormous than the cost of a very simple re-blocking that did not consider traffic management and its repercussion at all by the contractor and an insensitive regional or district DPWH offices. Imagine, some are already sacrificing to use the Ambuklao road via Baguio just to go to manila because of the mismanagement of the re-blocking that is taking too long. ii) Daang Matuwid and your Unquestionable Integrity and Performance Hon. Singson that regain the respect for DPWH will go down the drain just because of what is now happening to Dalton Pass. iii) Many voters will be disenfranchise for those who will be leaving manila to the provinces and from the provinces to Manila on the night of May 8,2016 because by then they will only arrive home about 6PM of May 9,2016 as what we are experiencing since the latest re-blocking project started. (actual experience today May 1-2,2016 left banaue ifugao at 7 pm on Sunday, reach aritao at 10pm and stranded sta fe until 8Am of Monday and reach manila 6PM of Monday) Suggestions: i) there are several single PCCP blocks that were removed and replaced and are causing one way traffic, can we design this for a 3-7 days concrete and cover these with metal flat sheets so that it can be opened to traffic right away. Further, the shoulder could be widened and improved temporarily as detour. ii) For several short span bridges (about 5) undergoing retrofitting: Why are they not constructed simultaneously and immediately after the steel bars and form works are placed. Again, these can be provided with bypass over the prepared section and or inclusion of detour. For instance, I saw one bridge is finished and what was remaining is the approach connection only but was left undone and it causes one way traffic for several days already, why? Another bridge with in-placed steel bars but not poured. This will go viral in social media am sure in the next few days if no improvement will be made to reduce the inconveniences of the riding public. I would be happy to receive any respond from those staff managing the secretary's affair. Very Truly Yours, Engr. Ericson Mammag\"",

Commuters have been suffering from heavy traffic especially during rush hours and also during the months of November to December. But it seems that heavy traffic within Metro Manila is now an all year round occurrence. Our streets are not expanding but our population and vehicles on the road are growing yearly. The project of your department to link the SLEX and NLEX is a very good undertaking and our company fully supports it since we use both toll ways to reach to our client-schools. Last year when several DPWH surveyors marked the site of where to place the posts or supports of the Skyway Stage 3, particularly posts PS3-64 and PS3-65, these posts are marked directly in front of our office lobby and main warehouse garage. As the Skyway Stage 3 project will obstruct our building along G. Araneta Ave it will also obstruct the normal flow of our business. May we then request that the mentioned posts be moved or adjusted in a way it will not impede our normal business operations? We are hopeful for your favorable reply. Thank you very much. JORGE A.

I noticed that this said repair was already in progress since my arrival from Australia in January 11, 2015 but was not completed since then. For the record, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been more than two months now since I saw this \\xe2\\x80\\x9con-going construction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Though there is little progress since January, unfortunately and just to emphasize, the remaining unpaved part of the road takes more than two months now and counting. As of this writing, it is not even improving at any pace, as there were no construction workers working on it (day or night) and the truck is apparently stuck only for display. Please note and as we know, this remaining unpaved road has caused massive traffic jams every morning and afternoon/evening especially during rush hours, including even weekends. Again as a matter of fact during morning rush hours, vehicles from Cavite to Manila needs to counter flow and occupy the opposite lane/direction just to lessen the burden of those going to their offices, among other errands. However, this is still not an effective and efficient way to address the situation which also compromises the time/resources of those going to Cavite, and ultimately worsens the traffic condition further. As you are probably aware of, this has adverse effects to people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s productivity, resources such as money and time, among other delays such as delivery of goods etc. Attached are some pictures I personally took supporting my report for your information, reference and appreciation of what is the reality. I hope that concerned agencies take this seriously and with utmost urgency so as not to cause further adverse effects to the people, and the economy as a whole.

I was asked to follow-up on the status of a billing collection and to comply should there be any other requirements needed for it to be approved. In which I did what I was asked to do and everything went fine. In fact, all the people together with the Section/Unit Heads that I inter-acted with were very courteous and accommodating. And I so much admired the working attitude with the most of them. After all its supporting papers were checked by the ICU officer, the folder/voucher I was tasked to follow-up was forwarded to the Accounting Section. And there, they asked for another requirement wherein I also complied. It is just so happen that the original document will be coming from Manila and so an advanced copy were faxed as the original will be sent via parcel delivery. Sir, I would like to ask for your attention in reviewing the performance of Ms. Evangaline C. Manalo, Accountant III. She is the Head of the Accounting Unit here in DPWH \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5th LED. Among all the officers and staff working in this noble institution, Ms. Manalo is the exact opposite of them all. It is so easy for her to curse at any person whom she finds lower than her position in office. I was one of those lowly people she has raised her voice with as she pointed her finger towards me, scolding me, accusing me and saying so many things that were not part of my purpose of being there. I tried to talk and ask around with other people whom like me, being a Liaison Officer, processes billing collections from licensed contractors with regards to what they can comment about Ms. Evangeline Manalo and we all shared common observations and experiences about her, among them were: - Very unaccommodating - Tactless, curses at people naming them with very unpleasant words - Humiliates other people with rude and degrading remarks - Always frowning and very unfriendly - Unprofessional with her actions as well as with her words - Capricious and very fickle minded - Uncooperative and very difficult to approach Even the people working in DPWH 5th LED can also attest that Ms. Manalo is the most difficult person to work with. I pray that you would give ample attention on this matter sir. And if it is possible, I would greatly appreciate it if my name would be held with discretion when you consider and look into her work ethics. Thank you so much, God Bless and more power to you. Very sincerely and respectfully yours, Jose Manuel G. Ca\\xc3\\xb1ete'",

        "body": "The Ribsuan bridge along Baguio - Bauang road had already been closed to trucks in the last quarter of 2014. It was reopened to all types of vehicles early 2015 but again closed to trucks last September 17,2015. Earlier this year, we noticed a DPWH signage posted on both ends of the bridge to wit: REPLACEMENT OF (PERMANENT) WEAK BRIDGE, RIBSUAN BRIDGE CONTRACTOR: ST. GERRARD CONSTRUCTION DATE STARTED: MARCH 5, 2015 CONTRACT DURATION: 182 CALENDAR DAYS CONTRACT COST: PHP 59,427,143.31 IMPLEMENTING OFFICE: DPWH, REGION I What saddens us is that the contract duration for the replacement bridge is almost over, but no semblance yet of a new bridge to be erected is visible,not a single post whatsoever can be seen. What can be seen in the area is that they are repairing a very small portion (12 sqm) of the pavement of the old steel bridge, and its taking them forever. We haul our cement from Holcim at Bacnotan, La Union; our hollowblocks from Bauang, and concrete aggregates from Naguillan. We waste so much time and fuel if we pass thru Marcos Highway, aside from the danger it poses to life and property because of its very steep terrain. We also aggravate the traffic at the city proper if all trucks pass thru Marcos high way. Finally, Naguillan/Quirino highway is a major thoroughfare, there is no wisdom in closing a portion of it to trucks because this will negatively impact on businesses. At least, provide a detour route.'",

The contractor who was tasked to do repairs on the said dike proved to be a negligent one, as he allowed the dike to be eroded. Worse, when the dike collapsed, he and his men were nowhere to be found. As of this writing, the river is still threatening to overflow and submerge our locality's estimated 400 families, as only a few sandbags remain as our defense from the rampaging waters of the mighty pampanga river. What makes matters worse is the inevitability of the coming of the rainy season, as repairs will surely take some material time to be made. In this regard, we are imploring your good office to initiate the necessary repairs of the collapsed portion of the arnedo dike, if only to dissuage the fears of the people of san vicente of an impending catastrophe.

Ang concern ko ay tungkol sa isang project along Brgy. Luzviminda II, Area F, Dasmari\\xc3\\xb1as City, Cavite specifically in front of Bahay Pangarap Subdivision. A road project was started here recently near a creek. Before na gawin ang project na \\xe2\\x80\\x98yon, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a problem kasi hindi naman nag o-overflow ang creek. Noong ginagawa ang kalsada, nagkaroon ng tambak in both sides of the road which blocked the water na makapunta sa creek. Then, recently noong umulan\\xe2\\x80\\x94 about two days ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94 nagulat kami kasi biglang bumaha sa mga bahay ng residents doon. Never na bumaha ng ganoong katindi doon. Dati, kapag naulan, manageable ang situation. Pero nitong nakaraan, konting ulan lang ganon na agad kalala ang sitwasyon. Pumasok sa mga bahay ang napakaruming tubig at mga basura. Worst is hanggang baywang ang baha! First time talaga na nag-overflow ang creek at pumunta sa mga bahay ang tubig. Affected ang mga business ng local residents at may unexpected damages sa mga bahay. Yesterday, I talked to a man namely Damaso Constantino to address my concern. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99am not sure if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an engineer but I think he is. Tinanong ko kung sino ang may handle ng project pero sabi n\\xe2\\x80\\x99ya di raw sa DPWH, sa Sub-district engineering daw. Gusto ko lang iparating ang reklamo ko dahil parang wala naman silang ginagawa sa after effect ng project. Yes, nakumpleto ang road project at guminhawa ang mga jeepney driver pero papatayin naman nila ang mga residente. Napaka-delikado lalo na sa mga bata na naglalaro malapit sa creek. I suggest immediate action regarding my concern. Please have an inspection here to know the exact situation at ang after effect ng ginawang road project dito. Dati, hindi nangyayari yang mga \\xe2\\x80\\x98yan. Pero about two days pa lang after project completion, ganyan agad ang effect sa ulan. Paano pa kapag bagyo na?  Madalas na umulan ngayon at pag hindi nasolusyunan, delikado para sa mga residente. Nakakatakot ang bulwak ng tubig talagang delikado. Please have an immediate response regarding my concern. Thank you.'",

It had a target completion but it was moved yet we understand that there maybe complexities that the contractor and government is going through and still we waited patiently.But our dilemma right now is that its been months already since the completion was moved and that the project was in no progress. We The Students,workers and travelers are already suffering from the rerouting which add up minutes if not hours to our travel time, instead of spending it with our families and our studies or work if not rest,not to mention the increase in the fare and fuel which could have been used to other important things. I know all things are due to process but we hope that the project be not delayed anymore and that the historical value of the bridge be sustained. We hope that the project may be done already, the steel bars are already laid into place and waiting,concrete is the only thing needed to be poured for it to be finished that it will be back to its functionality. And not to mention the more the delay the more the money of the people is spent.Hence, we know there is still ripening/maturing time for the concrete. So may we sincerely ask your Honorable office to do an action that the Project be not be delayed anymore for the monsoon/rainy months are coming and it will not be an ache to all of us to travel around due to the rerouting, and that our parents,husband/wife,Family,Co-workers,friends etc. won't be worried about our safety and travel time anymore.\nThank you And God speed!\nSincerely,\nYour Boss\nThe Residents of Pangasinan\nThe People of the Philippines\"",

I am writing to your office due to the following concern: 1.national highway clearing along surigao-agusan del norte road (alegria road section) 2. urgent clearing/removal of our residence fence that is under our patented land and been there since 1979. 3. informal notice since we did not receive any notice from the requesting team from DPWH. Sir/Madam: i have a video record of our conversation/meeting between the DPWH personnel and our mayor and municipal engr. though i don't have an idea where to attached the said video as our evidence of the said informal meeting. they just ask our presence at instant in order to discuss the said road clearing according to the office of engr.Henry Cruz J. Marapao together with engr. edel pejan of DPWH surigao city. to give you an idea our land is along national highway and is a titled private residential land (we have all the legal documents that will prove our ownership and we paid our taxes regularly advance most of the time and we never miss a single payment since we owned the lot and our house been in this land since early 70's around 1973-1974 though we owned the land years before the construction of our house. and our fence in this said land been constructed since 1979 meaning it is not covered yet in the said Road right of way for the national highway. According to our municipal mayor dominador esma jr. that he will claim portion of the land as covered in the Road right of way for some and future LGU's development in the area covered within 15 meters from the center of the national highway to our land/house and according to the group of Engr. Henry Cruz J. Marapao and Engr. Edel Pejan that they will claim the 15 meters with or without our approval since it is covered to the 15 meters.the only affected part is our fence but it is a high-end type of fence. we will obey whatever the government required as long as it is covered within the EO no. 621, s. 1980 amended EO 113, s. 1955. all we ask is that since our fence and our house been built before this Executive order, we allow the DPWH to demolished our fence granting or an exchange that the DPWH will build the same structure after the 15 meters RROW in your/DPWH own financing. but according to engr. Maraparao and Engr. pejan of surigao del norte DPWH their office will not going to finance the reconstruction of our fence since there is no appropriation given by the DPWH national office and i guess they are talking about your office. they are too harsh in explaining things that is why we did the same gesture to them. all we ask is to have some legal basis to know if what they are saying is true. because corruption is very rampant now a days among our government officials and some other LGU sector. the other point is why is it the project of clearing only affects portion near our area? why not like surigo city that everyone is covered and affected? it seems that this DPWN employees will insist that our area will be considered as one of the first batch for demolition. why not start at the boundary of agusan del norte and surigao del norte just meters away from our area? if in the event that what the surigao DPWH engrs been saying that you will not pay for the reconstruction of our fence is true, please give us some government guidelines/executive orders/ and our a copy of approved program of work in order for us to make sure that the said program of work is executable in all areas in the same year baka kami lang dahil hindi kami bomoto po sa aming mayor ngayon. and quite frankly we smell some politics involve in this project? bakit kami lang apat na pamilya lang po ang first e demolish bakit next year pa ang iba? we are hoping for your immediate answer of this matter since we are afraid that the demolition from DPWH people will start anytime soon that is what they told us yesterday. thank you for your time mrs. eden\"",

Now I am writing again to ask if the project has ended. this area seems to have been left uncompleted - the culverts and canals have been like that since march. what are they waiting for this time? and look what they did to the property...they bulldozed the land and created that gap when it was not necessary after all. Then the chapel, the residents could not hold mass because of the mud, the water from the road now goes inside the chapel because no culvert was placed to divert the rain water. The culvert at the other side seems to have been left just like that...when will they attend to this? when the rains come? Please do not wait that I will again write the Secretary directly. I hope you can do something about all of these.'",

All they do is put gravel and sand...our brilliant engineers in DPWH can't seem to find a solution to the problem on why the road is eroding whereas 20-30 years ago wala namang problemang ganyan. Kung di nyo kaya ang problema, bakit pa kayo nandyan, ibigay ang pwesto at pasahod ng gobyerno sa mas kapableng engineer!!!\n\nYours Truly,\nThe Highway Warrior\nJohnny Dela Cruz\"",

There is a huge billboard proclaiming a P35 million \"preventive maintenance\" project covering a stretch of national highway that should be the envy of so many other LgUs.... Because it remains in good shape.\nAnd yet the DPWH will let a contractor dig it up and repave it?? For P35 Million?\nI don\\'t know if you have even traversed this stretch of highway but please do and soon. Before admin opponents pounce on it as an example of questionable projects as the elections near. And before the jackhammer does its work and actually destroys what is still good road! \nI know you are an honorable man Secretary Singson but this Eastern Samar project stinks. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if some investigative reporter picks up on this issue and exposes it on national tv or in the dailies. Then DAANG MATUWID\\'s critiques will have a heyday. Why and how do these things happen anyway? Even under your watch?\n(Ellen Tordesillas this is something for Vera Files if you ask me. Cecilia Victoria O. Drilon unless you want to pick this up? )\nMy cellphone ran out of battery due to the video clips I took of this road so if you need them just let me know. Because some people may not be telling you what you need to know. \nWe have never met but one member of the Cabinet, DOTC Secretary Abaya, knows me quite well and how insistent I can be when I pick up on an issue, since a few years back I picked up on an issue involving Secretary Abaya\\'s brother Peter, taking the latter\\' side, and didn\\'t let go. I feel as strongly about this matter as I did about the case of then DENR Usec Peter Abaya...\nSo I hope you or your staff can explain why a highway as good as this one from Lawaan to Buenavista will be dug up to the tune of P35 million - which could be better spent building roads where none exist at the moment. And I suspect there are still a lot of places in Eastern Samar which fit the bill... \nThank you po.'",

The traffic situation on the area was observed to be heavy and that kilometres of motorist were already piling-up until such a traffic aide advice light vehicular motorist to divert to a local road wherein telling us that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a short cut to reach San Jose City. Traversing more or less 700M  there was a temporary signage made of plywood an arrow left and markings of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTO SAN JOSE CITY\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Traversing again around 300m more or less an arrow left sign again, until we reach a certain rough road and there was a traffic aide letting us cross a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbox culvert\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in an irrigation canal then a concrete road, after around 200m there was a junction, an unnoticeable gravel road and the continuity of the concrete road. The motorist ahead of us followed the concrete road and we also followed. Traversing a combination of concrete and gravel road until we observed that we are already climbing a newly graded gravel road. I am already apprehensive because the terrain becomes winding and   seeing lights downhill believed to be San Jose City proper. Back of my mind reasons, that we were on the right track because of the effort that it was recently graded for the convenience of the motorist rerouting.  Until we are halted because motorist ahead of us stop. Thought it was due to traffic again. But I was already alighted because why we are in the middle of nowhere and in a roadway on a mountain side. We already wonder why it took so long that the motorist ahead us moves, until we received relayed messages of drivers ahead of us that no more road to traverse, that it was a dead end.\n\nThis time, I panicked, I was nervous, cold feel creep on my nerves, I rattled because of the thought that we were lost in the middle of nowhere and that it is almost 4:00 AM. What about if there were nice people around that might notice we were lost and that the thought of bad things might happened. Until we decided to turn around.  \n\nIf only there were enough traffic signages and traffic aide in every junction of the road to guide motorist especially it was dark not even street lights to guide us. It was a horrible and traumatic experienced and even me an employee of DPWH had to undergo these very traumatic experienced because of insufficient and lowly traffic management. I know even those who experienced the same fate that we have might curse the people who were responsible of what they have undergone/suffered.\n\nI hope this could be an eye opener that traffic management is very important in a road construction notwithstanding that there is a pay item on this on the Program of Works.\n\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n\n\nELEONOR C.

Nakakalungkot isipin na sa kabila ng mga balitang pag angat at pag unlad ng Bayan ng Sagay, nakakubli ang pighati at dalamhati ng mga biktima ng tulay na ito.\nWala man ako sa Pilipinas ngayon, damang dama ko pa rin ang takot at panganib ng mga mga mahal ko sa buhay at ng mga taong tagaroon. Ako po ay 6 na taon ng nagtatrabaho sa Kuwait at nangangarap na balang araw,makakasama ko ang aking pamilya  sa lugar kung saan ako sinilang. Sa lugar nan a masasabi kong ligtas at maunlad.\nUmaasa po ako at sampu ng mga mamamayan ng Sagay  City na  kayo at ang inyong programa ang makakatulong sa aming problema.\nMaraming salamat po.'",
