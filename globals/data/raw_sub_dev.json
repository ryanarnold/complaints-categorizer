Before I decided to put these thoughts into writing I repeatedly ask myself if it will benefit me, and my answer is no, because I am one of the casualties of war so to speak. Nevertheless, it will help clear things, recently the Department promoted an Engineer IV named Ma. Victoria Gregorio, mains office BAC office who has been separated in the service way before the rat plan, she has been working overseas for 3 or 4 years there, then after she decided to go home for good she returned in the service right after the chaos of the rat plan emerging as Project Manager.  Well, as long as I remember she did not avail of anything in the rat plan nor resigned nor file a LOA (clearly its not allowed to be on leave for that long in the government) unless she has an exemption to any other ordinary government employee.  Clearly her case is not because of loyalty with the department because there are dozens of Engineers in her rank that's been sticking their  with brains to their jobs in the dept hoping for a similar place where she is.  Anyway can anybody with authority that can explain how this happens? for the sake of what the Departments advocacy (marangal na serbisyo, tungo sa pagbabago)\n\nMore power and more answers pls.

The legacy u can leave the DPWH is giving back the confidence of people in the agency. But the efforts we have exerted so far has only lasting effect. the fact that there are officers, middle managers that are very protective of their wards despite the misdemeanor they do is an indication that the straight path we advocate is not yet inculcated in their way of life. Our respectable USEC Medenilla's support of MS MARIA Antoinette PUNO, the OIC chief accountant is so evident, her incompetence notwithstanding. Her errors in judgement have caused the agency enormous troubles in terms of money and delays. We are committed to perform at least 70 percent of the agency target but at the rate We are going, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REACH IT. After the double payments were discovered we are wondering how many double payments are out there remaining to be discovered. Up to now, no recommendation or changes in the system have been installed to safeguard against double payments. All she did was pass the blame on the person who encoded the transaction. Thanks to u sir, the contractor returned the erroneous payment made after 3 months. at least because of your good screening of contractors for the agency, we have legit contractors as clients.

We would like to request that our 6 meter national highway bridge in Solano, Tanauan, Leyte, be repaired at the earliest time as it has been almost one and a half years since it was destroyed by the Super Typhoon Yolanda. At the moment, alternate route is being used by residents of Tanauan and the nearby towns Dagami and Burauen. This route is through the Tanauan market using the almost more than 50-year old Embarkadero bridge, and the \"newer\" bridges along the diversion road of Tanauan, Leyte. As the Embarkadero bridge is almost older than us, we fear that what happened to Hiagsam bridge in Jaro, Leyte could happen to our Embarcadero bridge considering the additional load, of all commuters and vehicles small and heavy ones alike, it is subjected to since after the Yolanda destruction. We believe Embarkadero bridge is also even overdue for check up and maintenance repair. I reckon DPWH is also concerned of depreciation of its infrastructures. We witnessed that there had been work started on the repair of the Solano bridge but it seemed to have been abandoned long before its set completion date of February 20, 2015. There are materials such as hardened cement, steel bars and boulders left at the site. There are already rumors bordering on SOP and corrupt officials concerned on the repair of said bridge. I, however, choose to still count on the honest and concerned service of DPWH, all its officials and employees. It is with this fervent hope that we pray to see that this request merits your prompt and able action as we were informed the request for budget is already at the DPWH Central Office.
