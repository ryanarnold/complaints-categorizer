The teacher was given seven stitches in a hospital.\n\nDepEd Assistant Secretary Tonisito Umali said school principal Joel Lariba has already submitted an official report to the DepEd and to the DPWH about the incident.\n\nEngineer Virginia Batocail, CDO assistant district engineer, earlier inspected the school's toilet and found defects in the construction of the toilet bowl.\n\nRecords show that the contractor, GIM PAB Enterprises, had shouldered the medical expenses of Alemanio and extended to her P15,000 financial assistance.\n\nThe toilet bowl was also replaced by the contractor.\n\nGIM PAB is also responsible for the construction of toilets in six other schools.\n\nThe DPWH is looking into possible defects in the toilet bowl, in which case the contractor will be held liable, or the improper use of the bowl as the reason for the accident.\n\nThe DepEd is doing its own investigation to make sure the incident does not happen again.\n\nThe comfort rooms were constructed in 2013, a project implemented by the DPWH.\n\nBased on standard operating procedures, the contractor has a one-year liability for any maintenance or correction of defects in the infrastructure.\n\nThe DPWH, DepEd and the school division are the ones who sign the certificate of completion before the infra project is turned over to the school.\n\nUmali said this is the first time they've received reports of this nature.\n\nHe assured the public of the safety of public school facilities, specially given the regular inspections done by each school's own personnel."}, {"category": "6", "id": "CFMC-20151246", "body": "@DPWHph @iamxtelific @ShingKikay @jerayeli @blissandvoid Doc. states deadline on July 15, 2015.

The last reply dated January 27 from your District Engineer says: \"After effecting the proper and appropriate coordination with the City Government, the Contractor has already resumed the project implementation and shall complete the project within this month.\" Today is March 21 and I want to show you the development of your project. Please see attached files named \"Picture 1 Before\" and Picture 1 Now\" also the files \"Picture 2 Before\" and \"Picture 2 Now\". You can see that there was no development in your project. How can you \"complete the project within this month\", as you claimed? My observation about your project is that, there are numerous projects being implemented in the City of Iloilo simultaneously and you awarded the contract to only certain contractor WITHOUT CHECKING IF THIS CONTRACTOR IS CAPABLE WITH MANPOWER to do the job. You can not see any worker at daytime working in this project, they only comes at night, few of them, and work for short hours then leave. They will come back again after 3 to 5 days to work again because the contractor is pulling them out to work on another project in the city. \"Picture 3\" shows the status of their work 4 days ago...nothing happened after that. I wonder if the district engineer is also checking their work. Does DPWH impose fines to contractor who failed to complete the project on time? surely they have Surety bond before they start the project. We, the taxpayers, are paying for this project cost. The project started FEBRUARY 2014 with a Contract Completion of 60 days and now its OVER ONE (1) YEAR and still not finish. I hope you will do something NOW about this matter.

Along Lubogan, Toril Davao city road connecting calinan davao city roads There was this road widening. We were called thrice about it.

They made the one lane roads to its standard width from the previous street size road. They dig for canals and cemented them opposite our side of the house. Then they just destroyed our side of canals and our cemented drive way sometime in August 2013. Then the contractors just stop operation. Then this month their back in operation. Yesterday because its weekday nobody is in our house. They again dig the canal. They did not return the wooden bridge for me to able to cross to the gate of my house, the wooden bridge they provided when we complained way back August 2013 the time they destroyed our drive ways. Now the canal is just about 4 feet deep i cant jump to my gate. I just pass the wooden bridge of my neighbor. I observe one house about five houses away. Their canal same as mine was dig. But their drive ways are fixed with culvert for easy passage they dont even have driveways cemented previously they are just newly built house. My comment and question: Do i need to guard to be home inorder to catch them digging canal and inorder for me to be able to request for culvert or to request to fix what they destoyed? Do i have to buy that culvert? So that what that beautiful house has should also be provided outside my house? Do i have to have car for them to provide culvert and to return back the concrete drive way they destroyed last year? This digging and destroying our previously functional canal has made us much inconvenience. We experience flooding the time they destroyed our canals on 2013.

While the Apayao part has been cemented, THIS PARTICULAR stretch on the CAGAYAN portion has been forgotten and neglected for as long as this road has been established. This is impacting the residents of Flora, ta. Marcela, Apayao and Ayaga, Cagayan. This has a tremendous pabigat to everyone because this is the only exit and entry road to and out of Flora and Sta Marcela where hundreds of students have to pass through in order to get to their colleges and schools, and to the merchants and in general the local economy. Rumurs have it that the Gov. Bulut, Jr. of Apayao even offered to the Governor of Cagayan that they complete this as a oint project. However, I firmly and strongly believe, this rad is UNDER your jusrisdiction. THIS particular road should be a priority, and we do not understtand why it hasn't been.

Nandiyan ang mag asawang Darwin Valdez at Rachele Caburian, magkapatid na Bernadete at Matson Piniera, RJ Manuel, pawing mga kamag anak ni AO, pati na rin mga SRM ay nag tatrabaho sa loob ng office sapagkat mga kamag anak lahat ang mga ito at hindi naman sa kalsada nagtatrabaho. Tinatago ng AO ang mga perment posisyon sapagkat hinihintay na pumasa ang mga kamag anak at makakuha ng illegibility kung kayat hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa tapos ang rationalization sa distirtc na ito.\n\nGusto po din naming na imbestigahan niyo ang employment records ng AO sapagkat kadudaduda din po ang mga ito. Noon October 2005, palihim siya na kumuha ng civil service exam, na noon ay may permanent position na siya. Lumalabas na napermanente na siya bago pa makakuha ng civil service legibility.\n\nSi AO ay isa rin contractor at supplier sa loob ng office. Noon panahon ni D.E. Pio Pre, talamak na pagnanakaw ang ginawa ng mga grupong ito. Ang Badoc School Building na pina imbestigahan po ninyo ay siya ang gumawa, sa pangalan ng contractor na Badoc Builders. Pati din ang trabaho sa Pinili-Nueva Era Roadna ilan ulit na imbestigahan na hindi na natapos tapos ang trabaho ay isa pang gawa ni AO, at sa huli ay ang maintenance section ang nagtapos sa trabaho. Ang overpriced na generator set sa office ay ideliver din ni AO lahat ng ito ay sa pangalan ng Valencerina Constructions. Ang mga ito ay ilan lamang sa madaming anumalya ng AO na ito. Bakit di natin pa lifestyle check si madam AO para naman Makita kung saan galling ang mga yaman nya ngayon na kahinahinala.\n\nMay mga reklamo na rin isinampa laban sa kanya, ngunit wala pa rin kasagutan sa mga reklamong ito.

A4, entitled \"Insanity and never-ending corruption in DPWH\" authored by Mr. Rick Ramos, Executive Director of InfraWatch, to wit: \n\nThere appears to be No End to the unbridled corruption at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), a favorite government agency of President Benigno S. Aquino 3rd whose leadership he greatly admires.\n\nLast Tuesday, April 7, President Aquino inaugurated a bridge in Isabela and once again commended the DPWH \"leadership of Secretary Rogelio Singson.\" As usual, P-Noy once again took the golden opportunity of blaming the past administration of their failure to build the bridge that was damaged in 1993.\n\nOf course, what the pathetic President B. S. Aquino 3rd will never tell and admit to the Filipino people and the world is that the past three presidents before him - Fidel V. Ramos (FVR), Joseph Estrada (ERAP), and Gloria M. Arroyo (GMA) - started and built more public infrastructure than him. In a short span of 2.5 years of the Estrada presidency, ERAP initiated the 88-km Subic-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) that was completed during GMA's time.\n\nThe P773 Million Lullutan Bridge is another 'concrete proff\" (to use his own words) of the Never-Ending corruption in the DPWH under the Daang Matuwid Aquino administration. With a length of 500 linear meters, it should have cost P250 million at P500,000 per linear meter (LM). Hence, an Obscene Overprice of P500 Million!!!\n\nThe price of P500,000 per LM is the cost of high-quality bridges in the private sector. This is what it will cost property developers like Ayala Land, SM Prime Holdings, DMCI and others in their projects. In fact, P500,000 was the cost of the Elevated Skyway along South Luzon Expressway (SLEX).\n\nThe 420-meter Mambaling fly-over in Cebu City only cost P110 million when it was built by DPWH in April of 2011. Thus, the cost of P262,000 per LM!!!Even if you double the figure due to inflation and increase in DPWH corruption, it should be P500,000 per LM. But the P773-million 500-meter Lullutan Bridge in Isabela inaugurated by P-Noy cost THREE TIMES-P1,546,000 per LM.\n\nYet President B. S. Aquino 3rd has the brazen temerity - or just sheer stupidity - to cite the \"5Rs\" of the DPWH \"under the leadership of Secretary Rogelio Singson\" - the \"Right Project, Right Quality, Right People, Right Time and the Right Cost.\" For starters, we can be sure the Lullutan Bridge was NOT BUILT at the Right Cost!!!\n\nTo give you an idea of the shameless and obscene overprice, the 1.23 km four-lane tunnel in Cebu City built during the last year of the President GMA cost P1,341,000 per LM. Even factor in inflation of 20 percent over the past 4.5 years and it will cost you only P1.6M per linear meter. The two-lane Lullutan Bridge cost P1.546M per LM. Remember that the Cebu Tunnelhas FOUR LANES!!!\n\nSHAMELESS CORRUPTION IN MANILA AND BAGUIO\n\nThe REBLOCKING by DPWH along EDSA and C-5 during the Holy Week caused humongous traffic. The worst part is that there was NO NEED to destroy the concrete pavement along EDSA and C-5 since they were still in good condition. If there were any minor cracks, they could easily be repaired. Worst part is that DPWH will spend another P3.7 billion along EDSA for the asphalt overlay.\n\nBased on the monitoring of the Citizens Infrastructure Integrity Watchdog (InfraWatch) for the past five years (201-2015), Baguio City holds the dubious distinction of being one of the most corrupt as far as DPWH projects are concerned. Among the regional centers, Baguio comes close to Iloilo City, which is the \"Corruption Capital of PH\" when it comes to public infrastructure that involves the DPWH, DoTC and the LGU.\n\nBaguio is the regional center of the Cordillera Autonomous Region (CAR), while Iloilo is the regional center of Western Visayas (Region VI).\n\n\n(DISCLOSURE: THIS WRITER IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INFRAWATCH)\n\nWhat has become the brand or \"trademark\" of the DPWH Daang Matuwid is it's nefarious \"REBLOCKING\" projects where good concreted pavements are destroyed only to be concreted again. During the holidays last Holy Week, DPWH did its despicable \"REBLOCKING\" on roads perpendicular to Session Road (near the Cathedral) and Leonard Wood Road (beside Cabinet Hill). What is worse here, as what the DPWH contractors did in EDSA and C-5, is that the sections of the roads \"REBLOCKED\" are not even cut/sliced (longitudinal) first so as not to damage the contiguous sections or lanes.\n\nThe brazen temerity of the DPWH-CAR is further demonstrated by the flagrant \"REBLOCKING\" of the Sto. Tomas Road leading to Green Valley and to the top of the mountains where the radar stations are located. The 200-meter section that has been demolished and is being concreted located is in front of the Dairy Farm of the Department of Agriculture. The Sto. Tomas Road, which starts at the Marcos Highway is well-paved with asphalt overlay.\n\nThe District Engineering Office in Baguio has also undertaken road-widening that serves no purpose to add capacity because they are narrow at 1.5-2.0 meters wide and are not contiguous. They will just become parking areas along the national highway, such as in Kennon Road and along Ferguson Road fronting the huge property of the Department of Agriculture (DA) for the CAR. This type of road widening projects by the DPWH has been done in other areas in Luzon, such as Sta. Rosa-Tagaytay Road in Laguna near SLEX.\n\nSpeaking of the 30-km. Kennon Road that begins at Camp I in Tuba, Benguet and runs to Baguio City, it is amazing that it is not a smooth well-paved national road in spite of the hundreds of millions of pesos spent by the Daang Matuwid \nAquino administration. Instead of doing simple and fast asphalt overlay on the pavement, Secretary Singson would prefer the more expensive and unnecessary \"REBLOCKING\" that leads to bigger project costs that benefit both the contractors and officials of DPWH.\n\nResidents of Baguio and environs (Tuba, Sto. Tomas, La Trinidad and Sabang), as well as visitors to the country's smmer capital can only shake their heads and wonder why DPWH indulges in such acts of insanity. But then, corruption in the favorite government agency of P-Noy has become so inordinate (excessive) that lunacy may be an understatement.\n\n'CONGRATULATIONS' TO DPWH ON ITS 'ACHIEVEMENTS'\n\nAfter almost five years of the Aquino administration, perhaps it is time to \"congratulate\" DPWH for its outstanding \"achievements\" that will become its legacy to the Filipino people. Other than its notorious \"REBLOCKING,\" DPWH has implemented asphalt-overlay that is not even needed on national highways, such as Sucat Road (A. Santos Ave.) in Paranaque and the Sta. Rosa-Tagaytay Road in Laguna.\n\nWorse, DPWH applied double asphalt overlay 5 cms (4 inches) thick so that pavements are now as high or higher than the sidewalks. Worst, DPWH created a problem for vehicles crossing these raised/elevated national roads."}, {"category": "5", "id": "CAAC-20131006", "body": "47 Gen St., Sariaya, Quezon\n\nMaharlika Highway\n\nHinukay ang ilalim ng sidewalk ng tulay (Mamala River).

As a matter of fact, \"ang baho ng isa damay lahat\" (lahat sila ay nakinabang).  Actually, they are all, until this month celebrating and joined together in all occassions with their office (affairs, celebrations, ect) of this person Manuel Taguba who used on the other hand, also SMT Construction as of this time, if you can check the vouchers recorded under this who received and authorized transactions by the said contractor to Manuel Taguba.  To recap, Taguba's \"Manugang\" -SMT contractor.  He was notified that the ES Pua was disqualified (suddenly, as issued brought out) recently to used the said license for all projects at DPWH.  And what about those text messages from D.E Costales to Manuel Taguba readed by his family member that causes irks ....\"you pray\"...and also I love so much!\" pass 9pm dated ___? and other previous messages.  What these connotes?   All are poison to her management and well admired bla bla?  Oh really, gosh!  \n\nLahat sila po ay nakikinabang sa taong ito from meal to personal expenses of anybody in office, here, if you can check canteen at DPWH list of employees meal paid of Manuel Taguba in lieu of all projects given to him?  What about visitors and bid committee members he also provided food everytime bidding he took and pre negotiated dealed projects given to him?  What about the \"lechon baka\" - a demanded gift to her married \"anak\" last month to Manuel Taguba?  The cash gifts given to 3 Project inspectors from Manila to certain projects of Manuel Taguba recently just to pass it without demeanors( punchlist)?  Even visitors of D.E that his boylet too provided meal and accommodations but under expenses of DPWH recorded?  and so forth.  \n\nOf course, those are all negative, against that will lead her and staff not only to big slap issue and immorality but work suspension and/or termination as according to Civil Service Commission guidelines to all government workers mandated that's why they instructed him to use other and spared contractors licence since then.  Very ideal system implemented right?  They earned and given priviledges such that projects involved push through.   As a matter of fact, Manuel Taguba was instructed \"skip' muna daw siya, ska magparticipate this October listed nine projects unahin lang un lima at sa iba contractor muna daw ibibigay (dahil sa issue na nabulgar?) kaya wait lang siya bigyan ulit ni D.E.  She is happily married?  Really, how come, la si husband nasa ibang lugar kaya pala lagi together sila before start ng work, breaktime, lunch breaktime and til uwian time.   Laughs,  I can't imagine.. Why is it the investigating committee should use civilian spy to know the real issue behind the all allegations made/thrown to her \"love, admire......management? Ulk!  Those talks and negotiations where indeed louder than everything escapades here.  Manuel Taguba always stayed there inside her office talo pa nga niya empleyado araw araw andun siya uuwi babalik.. Ksama sa lahat ng okasyon pa..tagabayad ng lahat ng expenses nila.  Napakaganda nga denial queen epek niya mga bosing.\n\nLahat sila nagsusugal sa office tama pati inuman ng bigla merun ngcomplain kaya ngmemo kuno si D.E at dina sila ganun ka frequent maglaro.(after months back to usual).  Pwde din po natin icheck all whereabouts ng mga sugalerong staff ni D.E kung nasan during office hour like Arthur na lagi ksama kasugalan ni Taguba kapag di pwde sa office, sa house at kung sinipag pa at maalala babalik office uwian time na after that.\n\nOne night after office hour, the newly auditor there as coded \"bading\" kagaling sa kantahan sa folkhouse at si D.E todo kanta kay boylet \"kahit matanda na sila pa rin\" ....then everyone DPWH staff's laughing all the while.  Simplehang garapalan at bulgar di po ba?Napakaraming okasyon sa DPWH tulad sa resort nearby na ginanap at si boylet andun nagprovide ng lahat inumin pag kain ng mga taga DPWH as \"pakikisama\" daw un at SOP bilang contractor (di pa nman makakuha si boylet ng license sa PCAB, feeling gnun na dhil sa mga hiniraman ng license).    Napaka selosa ni D.E kay boylet niya even phone calls galit siya at usapan nila ay di nalayo sa usapang may relasyon, the boylet decide and dictated for her too kaya lagi nakabantay talo pa bodyguard.  Kung merun lng CCTV kakanta HULICAM ang tagpuan galaw lahat ng dalawang ito sa loob at labas ng opis kasama lahat ng kausap na mga empleyado dun hanggang sa Accounting Section.  Nakarecord din dapat lahat ng IN and OUT sa opis na stated dun Manuel Taguba daily guard on duty records.  Unless shut up and deleted na din.  Pro kung merun po taung mg spy at mg video kita lahat yan.  Unknown to all in that DPWH office ang ipapadala mg imbestiga ayos na ayos po ang lahat ng allegations.  Tikom kasi mga staff niya na naambunan.\n \nI presumed that this letter are confidentially kept and secretly investigated with civilian spy of DPWH to trace all corruptions and immorality between them.  For security reason ko po din kung ibibigay ko pa po lahat nalalaman details ko sa knila at tiak po akong malalaman na nila ang identity ko po as complainant/concerned citizen na ngmamalasakit sa pamilya ng Taguba na iniputan ang wife na paralyzed  in just...in behalf of project earnings given.  \n\nNakita nabasa ko po un sinabi ni D.E na lahat ay big LIES.  Shes working in government yet behind nabahiran ng ganun gawain sa ilalim ng pamunuan ng DPWH.  Eleven percent (SOP nila ) of total projects costs per project ang deal lang po nila dati sa boylet but more than that pti sarili kasama na.  Kaya hatian hay naku kagaling sobra.  Napakaraming mystery sa office nia po where usually boylet stayed even sleep sa pgod after session nila.   A resting place and lovenest.   Kaya  boylet used to renovated the office.  Di pa nga daw nakakolekta la pa daw budget.  Team mate sila po..  Pati adjustment hocus focus sa project details nadinig din sa usapan.  \n\nYes, aside spy, CCTV will be a great help to justify and clarify things...plus the guard records daily and all transactions under those contractors lended of Manuel Taguba who authorized all transactions/projects NOA, NTP recipient, in behalf--SIGNATURES of him could not deny it.   In every sealed envelope of bid docs submitted handed naka affix lahat ng pirma po ng iisang tao gumamit ng lisensia ng contractor na walang iba Manuel Taguba... la po kilala or even connections ang mga nsabing contractor na ngpahiram kay Taguba sa taga DPWH under D.E Costales ni mukha nga nila di nakita dun o uma appear sa bidding kundi si Taguba lamang.\n\nI suggest na mgkarun ng revision enhancement ang Accreditation policy ng DPWH sa mga contractor na kung saan matrace ang nagpapahiram or authorzed attendee sa bidding.  \"TUNGO SA DAANG MATUWID' ngkanda liko liko na, nalihis sa perang nakakamal ng ganun ganun na lamang.  Tingin ko po la na ata konsensia.  Nagpapa feeding program pa siya eh pagtalikod ayun sila dalawa po.\n\nUnfair sa other contractors before pro ngayon po nagkarun na ng puwang makakuha ng other contractor makaiwas issue nlang KUNO pro dhil sa DENIAL effect ni madam at sa boylet...di po ata fair na di maibentigahan hanggang sa dulo ang mga pangyayari nabulgar po.  DEEP and thorough investigation hence requested for fair and justice.  After this revelation lets again hear the result of the Civilian SPY, records in Accounting as well as guard on duty and so forth in related to this case. Bid TRANSPARENCY, revamp and good moral value still best.\n\nAgain, I presumed that this letter will not be forwarded to D.E and staff not only for security reason that boylet will really threaten my life but also endanger my kids as well later on.  Pakiusap.   Ang sa akin po kaayusan, katarungan, karapatan ng bawat isa nawa maibigay ng sapat..tungo sa ankop na manggagawa ng ahensiya in service and leadership.  I suggest  also not to take her leave of absence while investigation on going ksi nga po di mahuhuli ng isda.  Isang kumpas lang ni madam tumatahimik na paligid papanu pa po makakakuha ng exact data.  Maybe will attend other bid committee without her knowledge na dun mtrace un specimen signature ng representative na nka affix sa lended contractor and everything (vouchers/documents/cheques).  Definitely malinaw makikita yun.  \n\nHoping all revelations here were kept confidential and security reasons of the person will be given consideration too.\n\nGod bless and more power.\n\nNote:\n\nThe investigating committee or team of DPWH can include the lifestyle check of this D.E Costales also the banning of the person boylet MANUEL TAGUBA to join in all bidding and or participation in all activities in DPWH offices or premises such that to avoid all negative issue that brought corruptions, anomalies and immorality as well.\n\nThank you\n"}, {"category": "1", "id": "CAAC-20130206", "body": "Hon.Rogelio Singson\nSecretary\nDPWH,Port Area Manila\n\nThru:Elizabeth Pilorin\nChief,Public Infomation Div.\n\nDear Secretary,\nA pleasant day to you sir,I know that you're always busy but i hope you will find time to read my e-mail to you which i believe will be beneficial to all concern.\nWe're temporary relieved to hear that the remedial course/exam was indefinitely postponed for reasons that only the ManCom knows,This remedial course/exam in the first place is inappropriate but just to cater favored few who were protegees of the ManCom members.The criteria set by the ManCom was deliberately made to qualify the son of a certain Undersecretary and personnel of region 02 who were all protegees of a former director who is now a member of the ManCom,please take note that those who qualified to take these remedial exam came from that region while nobody from other regions qualifies.Sir we believe in your sincerity in instigating reform in this Department but the very same men around you are the ones tarnishing the image of the dept.You cannot instill to us the core values like transparency,integrity, professionalism if the ManCom itself do not have these values.Some of these leaders of ours are former Dist engineers,Directors who were noted to have dubious records before they become Undersecretaries & Asst Secretaries and now have the powers to manipulate laws/dept orders,I therefore appeal to you dear Secretary to uphold your original decision that if we fail in the promotional exam then we'll have to take it again but not through short cut method crafted by the ManCom which their main purpose is to accommodate their favored protegees.

San Roque, Daram, Samar in 2008 at a cost of P4.7 M. that was tainted by gross anomalies resulting in massive under deliveries of materials & shoddy work. Then DE Jose Balite visited the proj. site with his staff & made a list of corrective work that needed to be done to complete the proj. Not one of these corrective work was done. The undersized pipes are still there as evidence. This complaint was made against Engr. Ruben de los Reyes of your 2nd Samar Engineering Dist. based in Catbalogan, Samar as we found out later that he was the one who actually sub-contracted the work on this proj. We would like to get a copy of the investigation report on this case. Two investigators from the Central Ofc. went to Bgy. San Roque, Daram  but they did not talk to the workers concerned nor to the officials of the Bgy. The Bgy. Capt. was never informed the result of such investigation. On the contrary, despite the complaints against Engr. de los Reyes he has been promoted to Asst. Dist. Engr. It has been many years since these complaints were filed & several letters have been sent to various DPWH & COA officials concerned. We did not get even the courtesy of a response to these letters as required by Civil Service rules. I was advised at your PIO & CIVIC to communicate with you directly on this matter. I hope that, with this e-mail, we will finally get a copy of the investigation report on this complaint. Thank you. We look forward to hearing soon from USec.

The signs which are placed about 50-100 meters before the site of road repair says: \"Sorry for the inconvenience, road repair ahead\".

Over Slippage na eto pero walang liquidated damages imposed sa contractor sa lagayan. Hindi naman nila na-follow ang contract quantities infact they deviate the plan - and reduced the length. Contract should supposed to have one variation order only mukhang nakarami eto kung ginawa nga? Ang excavation dito ay supposed to be 1.5m depth since ang lupa dito ay muck and peat. Ang ginawa nila dito ay nag excavate ng half meter, nag-embankment fill ng half meter(item 104) at nag slab na sila. Ang line canal naman na supposed to be removed, excavate and replaced ay pinatungan na lang nila ng 0.20m CHB then tinakpan ng sidewalk slab on top of it.

I\\'m an owner of two (2) adjacent lots with TCT 116577 and TCT 117138 (5000 M2, now less because of Eco Tourism Road)in Barangay Ibabang Talim, Lucena City, Quezon. At the back of my lot was a creek and a river which is now being quaried. Due to ongoing construction of Eco Tourism Road bridge my lot have been submerged by about 5 meters. This 2 lots were very important to me because this is where i plan my livelihood when i retire in a couple of years. Unfortunately these lots WILL NOT HAVE ANY VALUE BECAUSE IT WAS SUBMERGED BY ABOUT 5 METERS OR MORE ONCE THE BRIDGE ROAD IS FINISHED. I have pictures to prove this. I really concerned about the flooding that always happened in our country and the world due to climate change. I\\'m a living witness to that when typhoon Frank brought flood in that area. Please help me. I hope the goverment will do something about this. Hope this complain will not fall into debt ears. I do believe with Daang Matuwid of the goverment but i also need your assistance into this matter. I do not have the money or resources to level my lot to the bridge.

Small vehicles motorized/mechanical, bicycle, children, elderly and even farm animals from Barangay Ibabang Talim, BarangaySalinas, Barangay Ransohan, Barangay Ilayang Talim and other adjacent rural Barangays  will use this Underpass as a safest access. I have mentioned it from my previous messages the reasons that we are pointing why we are against the uplifting of Barangay road crossing Morong Bridge. \nYes i have a dialogue with the Project Engineer last March 4 but i did not agree to his proposal. In fact on that same day i have sent my 1st message on the \"Complaint/Feedback form of DPWH. \n\nThey have started pouring stones on the said intersection and we can\\'t do anything right now. As a matter of fact some residents are now restless and loosing hope. Yes we know that this is a goverment project and it\\'s very hard to oppose especially for the rural people/us.\n\nSir, I\\'m leaving the country tonight June 3 to join my ship in Romania and may not always monitor my emails due to limited internet access on the vessel. I will give you the email address of the ship once i\\'m onboard so that you can update me about this matter.The best thing i hope is for this project to address all the needs of the people in the area.\n\nI\\'m expecting all the support the DPWH will extend to me/us so that my lot will not be a catch basin of flood waters and to have good ,safe access to it as well. I hope that despite what happens my lot will still be productive when i retire and not completely loose its value.

There no signs of attention from DPWH. So I feel that no information was being given by the local officials since most of them are if not truckers owns busses. They may be afraid of having to detour which may cause them additional opex.

PILORIN\nStakeholders Relations Service\nDepartment of Public Works and Highways\nManila\n\nDear DIRECTOR PILORIN:\n\nIn all candor and humility owed to an informed judgment, I stand corrected in my August 13, 2015 letter denial of my November 7, 2014 letter \"seeking the implementation of our requested Project in our Local Government Unit (LGU) which was already approved by the DPWH.\"\n\nIt is almost a year since this project was begun, the highest and biggest infrastructure undertaking in the history of San Enrique had it materialized. As the Local Chief Executive I would have been very proud to initiate and implement such a project under my administration for the benefit of my town mates and constituents.\n\nI realize on hindsight, however, that since day one (1) of this project - (with Transaction ID: LR-CFMC-20151231) seeking Presidential intercession and posing great inconvenience to the Office of the President and the DPWH Main Office, to include its Regional and Provincial Arms in Region VI - I was being misled by certain individuals feigning and claiming close connections with Malacanang, DBM and DPWH. To continue a deal that has become untenable and muddled would practically shame and embarrass my office had I persisted. The many grey areas and procedural inconsistencies practically caused my disinterest as I wanted the transaction to be transparent and to follow the legal process. Hence, my decision to disengage and drop the entire project.\n\nThen, there is this paramount concern. That we conducted a public bidding on the belief that funds were to be made available soonest can neither be denied nor disowned. It stood to reason, however, that the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) did not award any contractor pending the notice of release of funds, which only showed that the bidding was above board and done in good faith.\n\nThank you so much for giving due course to this letter. I feel vindicated by the fact that, following the Tuwid na Daan precept, the Local Government Unit (LGU) of the Municipality of San Enrique has been spared from the scandal of implementing a highly questionalble project.\n\nMy sincerest apology.

Ang concern ko ay tungkol sa isang project along Brgy. Luzviminda II, Area F, Dasmari\\xc3\\xb1as City, Cavite specifically in front of Bahay Pangarap Subdivision. A road project was started here recently near a creek. Before na gawin ang project na \\xe2\\x80\\x98yon, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a problem kasi hindi naman nag o-overflow ang creek. Noong ginagawa ang kalsada, nagkaroon ng tambak in both sides of the road which blocked the water na makapunta sa creek. Then, recently noong umulan\\xe2\\x80\\x94 about two days ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94 nagulat kami kasi biglang bumaha sa mga bahay ng residents doon. Never na bumaha ng ganoong katindi doon. Dati, kapag naulan, manageable ang situation. Pero nitong nakaraan, konting ulan lang ganon na agad kalala ang sitwasyon. Pumasok sa mga bahay ang napakaruming tubig at mga basura. Worst is hanggang baywang ang baha! First time talaga na nag-overflow ang creek at pumunta sa mga bahay ang tubig. Affected ang mga business ng local residents at may unexpected damages sa mga bahay. Yesterday, I talked to a man namely Damaso Constantino to address my concern. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99am not sure if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an engineer but I think he is. Tinanong ko kung sino ang may handle ng project pero sabi n\\xe2\\x80\\x99ya di raw sa DPWH, sa Sub-district engineering daw. Gusto ko lang iparating ang reklamo ko dahil parang wala naman silang ginagawa sa after effect ng project. Yes, nakumpleto ang road project at guminhawa ang mga jeepney driver pero papatayin naman nila ang mga residente. Napaka-delikado lalo na sa mga bata na naglalaro malapit sa creek. I suggest immediate action regarding my concern. Please have an inspection here to know the exact situation at ang after effect ng ginawang road project dito. Dati, hindi nangyayari yang mga \\xe2\\x80\\x98yan. Pero about two days pa lang after project completion, ganyan agad ang effect sa ulan. Paano pa kapag bagyo na?  Madalas na umulan ngayon at pag hindi nasolusyunan, delikado para sa mga residente. Nakakatakot ang bulwak ng tubig talagang delikado. Please have an immediate response regarding my concern.

Marahil ay di nyo alam ang background ng taong ito na binigyan nyo ng Special Order para gawing OIC-ADE ng Pampanga 2nd Engineering District (S.O No. 75, S, 2015). Kaya heto po ang kamangha manghang tungkol sa kanya. 1. Siya po si NOMER ABEL P. CANLAS, dating radio operator ng Pampanga Sub-district Engineering Office noong District Engineer pa si USEC Rafael Yabut. Naging Administrative Officer ng Pampanga 1st District Engineering Office kapalit noon ni Ador Canlas na noo\\xe2\\x80\\x99y naging Assistant District Engineer sa Tarlac. 2. Napaka giliw niyang empleyado lalo na sa mga Contractors noong nasa Pampanga 1st District Engineering Office pa siya dahil siya ang nagaayos sa mga ito tuwing may bidding at nangongolekta ng SOP. 3. Nag-aral ng Civil Engineering at nag graduate noong 2013 habang siya ang Administrative Officer ng Pampanga 1st District Office ng hindi man lang nag file ng leave of absence kahit minsan. Ito ay sa panahon ni yumaong D.E. Jose Datu at sinundan ni D.E. Enrico Guilas. Sana ay imbestigahan naman ng Civil Service Commission ang Leave Card nitong taong ito. 4. Kumuha ng C.E. board examination pagka graduate ng hindi man lang nagreview pero pumasa. Dahil sa pagbabayad ng P150,000.00. Kaya po isa siya sa mga produkto ng \\xe2\\x80\\x9cR.A. 150\\xe2\\x80\\x9d kung tawagin namin dito sa Pampanga dahil hindi naman sila karapatdapat na gawaran ng R.A 1080. 5. Nag test sa Promotional Exam noong 2014 pero marahil dahil di puedeng bayaran ang CSC ay hindi pumasa. Subalit na promote parin bilang Engr. IV sa UPMO, mula sa pagiging administrative officer, sa tulong syempre ni USEC at ni Kuyang USEC, ito ay loob ng wala pang isang (1) taon mula ng siya ay nag graduate sa Republic Central Colleges. Mukhang naisahan na naman po ang inyong patakaran. Ang gagaling po nila diba? 6. Matagal na po naming naririnig dito sa Region III ang plano nila USEC at Kuyang Usec na gagawin siyang District Engineer Kapalit ni OIC-DE Juanito Reguyal na magreretiro sa Agusto, at heto na nga po ang kanilang unang hakbang, napa pirma nila ang isang Special Order na ginagawa siyang OIC-ADE. Puede po ba iyon kahit di nya naipasa ang promotional exam?. Hindi po ba pagmamanipula na naman iyon sa mga polisiya ninyo tungo sa pagbabagong anyo ng DPWH? Paki aksyunan naman po agad ito at baka gawan nila ng paraan na gawin siyang Regional Director. Magiging kaawa-awa na naman ang DPWH pag nagkataon dahil halata naman na wala siyang kaalaman sa Civil Engineering profession dahil puro pagkakaperahan lamang ang laman ng kanyang isip.

Mariano, dalawampu\u2019t isang taong gulang, tubong Pampanga. Ang mga magulang ko po ay sina July P. Mariano at Emily O. Mariano. Ang aking ama po ay kasalukuyang namamasukan sa DPWH bilang Job Order sa posisyong Project Evaluation Officer, mahigit sa labingwalong taon na po siya sa kagawaran, dati po siyang casual employee subalit dahil po sa rationalization plan ng gobyerno ay napilitan po siyang tumanggap ng isang Job Order na posisyon. Ang aking ina naman po ay mahigit dalawampung taon ng guro sa pampublikong paaralan ng Siran Guagua, Pampanga. May isa po akong kapatid na nagngangalang Jem, siya po ay walong taong gulang pa lamang. \n Hindi po naging biro ang naging karanasan ko noong ako\u2019y nag aaral pa dahil po bago ako mag umpisa sa kolehiyo ay nagkaroon ng Nasopharyngeal Cancer ang aking ama, naging mahirap po ang naging pakikipaglaban ng aking ama sa sakit na ito subalit po sa pagnanais pa niyang mabuhay para sa aming kanyang pamilya at sa awa\u2019t biyaya ng Diyos ay kaniyang napagtagumpayan ito. Subalit ang kanyang naging sakit ay nag iwan ng isang impairment sa kanyang kakayanang kumain ng normal. Sa kalagitnaan po ng kanyang treatment ay kinailangan syang lagyan ng Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube upang siya po ay makakain. Mag aanim na taon na pong ganito ang kalagayan ni daddy subalit nagsikap pa rin po siyang makabalik sa trabaho dahil alam niya na hindi kaya ng sahod ng aming ina ang mga pangangailangan ng aming pamilya. Nagsilbi po itong inspirasyon para sa akin upang aking pagbutihan ang aking naging pag aaral, sa mga iilang pagkakataon po ay naging Academic Achiever po ako at nakita ko po ang tuwa sa kanila, naging masaya rin po ako dahil napapakita ko sa kanila na kahit papaano ay hindi nasasayang ang kanilang mga paghihirap para sa akin, lalo na po hindi biro ang magpaaral sa pribadong unibersidad sa panahon ngayon.  Pinangarap ko pong makapagtapos sa lalong madaling panahon nang sa gayon ay matulungan ko po ang aking mga magulang at magantihan po ang naging maraming pagsasakripisyo po nila. Nakapagtapos po ako ng kursong Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communications Engineering, Abril ng nakaraang taon at sa awa po ng Panginoong Diyos ay napasa ko po ang board exam noong October 2012. Napakasaya ko po noong napasa ko ang board dahil muli ay nakita ko sa aking mga magulang ang tuwa, higit lalo po ay ang lisensyang nakamit ko ay magiging malaking tulong sa paghahanap ko po ng magandang trabaho.\nNapag alaman ko pong mayroong hiring sa DPWH Pampanga Second Engineering District para sa posisyong Computer Maintenance Technologist, dali dali po akong nag apply at nagsumite ng mga kailangang dokumento noong ika-14 ng Enero ngayong taon. Naging maganda po ang pagtanggap ng staff ng opisina, mula po sa District Engineer na si Engr. Juanito V. Reguyal hanggang sa Chief po ng Administrative Division na si Mrs. Jennifer Gonzales. Positibo po ang kanilang naging feedback sa aking application at sa kanilang naging evaluation po na ipinasa sa Regional Office ay ako ang kanila piniling inomina para sa posisyon. Noong ika-4 ng Pebrero ay kanila na nila akong pinapasok upang maumpisahan na ang aking training. Kahapon po, ika-5 ng Pebrero ay ginawa na nila ang resolution para gawin ng opisyal ang kanilang magiging pagkuha sa akin bilang empleyado, personal ko pong inihatid ito sa Regional Office upang sa ganoon ay mapirmahan na ng mga kinauukulan. Sinabihan po akong iwan na lamang ang mga dokumento at bumalik na sa District Office dahil ipapa deliver na lamang daw po. Naging hopeful po ako dahil pagkatapos mapirmahan ng resolution ay appointment na lamang po ang aking hihintayin at opisyal na akong makakapag umpisa sa trabaho. Ngunit biglang sinabihan po ako kanina na ayaw daw pong pirmahan ang aking resolution ng mga kinauukulan dahil mayroon daw pong ibang ilalagay dun sa posisyong inapplyan ko sa kabila ng rekomendasyon mula sa District Office. Nalaman ko pong pamangkin ng Construction Division Chief na si Engr. Lucito O. Sibug ang ibang aplikante. Nang malaman po ng Administrative Staff ng District Office ang balitang ito ay nagulat din sila dahil umaasa silang ang kanilang naging rekomendasyon ay aayunan ng Regional Director, Asst. Regional Director at iba pang kinauukulan.  Dismayado po sila dahil parang hindi iginalang ng mga kinauukulan ang kanilang naging desisyon, na parang nabalewala daw po sila sa nangyari. \nAng nais ko po sana ay mabigyan ako ng kasagutan ukol sa totoong nangyari, sa naging evaluation po ng qualifications naming dalawang aplikante ay ako ang nanalo, ako ang inendorso ng opisinang nangangailangan ng empleyado. Nakisalamuha at nagtraining na po ako sa opisina. Naging maaga po ako sa pagpasok sa naging training ko at sumunod sa lahat ng utos at patakaran ng opisina sa pagnanais pong magkaroon ng good impression sa akin ang mga ibang empleyado doon. Sinabihan po ako ng District Engineer ng personal na mas gusto niya ako para doon sa posisyon. Noong pirma na lamang po ng mga nasa posisyon ang kailangan para maging opisyal na akong empleyado, doon pa ako inilaglag? Ganoon po ba talaga ang patakaran sa gobyerno natin? Ganoon po ba ang sistema? Na nadadaig ng \u201ckamag anak at kakilala\u201d ang magandang qualifications at magandang educational background? Hindi po sa nais kong siraan ang aking kalaban sa posisyon subalit ang sabi po sa akin ay isa po siyang Computer Science graduate, isang apat na taong kurso na kanyang tinapos sa loob ng pitong taon. Hindi po ako nanghahamak o nagmamalaki, sinasabi ko lamang po ang katotohanan na aking narining. Hindi po ba\u2019t ang totoong purpose ng rationalization plan ay upang masiguradong lahat ng mga nanunungkulan sa gobyerno ay kwalipikado para sa posisyong hawak niya? Ganito po ba talaga?\nKami po ay simpleng pamilya lamang, hindi mayaman at walang kakilalang maimpluwensiyang tao. Walang masasandalan kapag kami po ginipit ng mga maimpluwensiyang tao. Pero naniniwala pa rin po ako sa inyong mga adhikain Mahal na Pangulo, na pantay pantay ang turing sa bawat Pilipino. Parehong oportunidad para sa mga tao regardless sa kung sino ang kamag anak o kabigan nila. Sana po ay sa sa aking munting paraan ay mapaabot ko po sa inyo ang aking naging karanasan. Maraming salamat po. \n \n \n \nLubos pong gumagalang,\nJulius Irvin O. Mariano"}, {"category": "10", "id": "CAAC-20130074", "body": "Re: Transaction ID No. 20121530/31\n\nThank you so much!

I had four surgeries since then. Titanum implants were screwed in my bones to facilitate healing on my cracked bones and completely broken bones. Medical operations have caused me more than a half million pesos. I was not able to work for several months covering the operations and recovery. My pain over what happened to me has not only affected me physically but to my over wellbeing as person. \n\nI discovered that the contractor of the said unfinished sidewalk was a relative of the seating mayor of Puerto Galera ( Mayor Christopher ATIENZA Dolor) , ENGR. FRANCISCO ATIENZA. A friend of mine complained to the local government but he was told that the road was already turned over to the local government thereby relieving the contractor of liability and advised him to rather file complaint against the Mayor and contractor here at DPWH.\n\nI have pictures of the open sidewalk for your reference as part of this faxed message. \n\nI was also told that an accident happened before my incident but no action was made to close it to prevent it from happening to somebody else.\n\nPuerto Galera is a tourist destination yet it is very clear that it\u2019s not safe to the locals and more so to local and foreign tourists.\n\nTo aggravate what happened, there was even no lamp post nor signages to alarm or inform the passersby of the open sidewalk.\n\nHonestly, I am complaining to compel the government to close the open sidewalk and obtain monetary damages on what happened to me.\n\nPlease update me and let me know if you need me to do anything to close this open sidewalk to prevent future accidents.\n\nI am also considering to file the necessary legal action if this matter is not addressed.\n\nHoping for your urgent response on this complaint.

This is to report stalled road repair located at Longos, Bacoor, Cavite. I noticed that this said repair was already in progress since my arrival from Australia in January 11, 2015 but was not completed since then. For the record, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been more than two months now since I saw this \\xe2\\x80\\x9con-going construction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Though there is little progress since January, unfortunately and just to emphasize, the remaining unpaved part of the road takes more than two months now and counting. As of this writing, it is not even improving at any pace, as there were no construction workers working on it (day or night) and the truck is apparently stuck only for display. Please note and as we know, this remaining unpaved road has caused massive traffic jams every morning and afternoon/evening especially during rush hours, including even weekends. Again as a matter of fact during morning rush hours, vehicles from Cavite to Manila needs to counter flow and occupy the opposite lane/direction just to lessen the burden of those going to their offices, among other errands. However, this is still not an effective and efficient way to address the situation which also compromises the time/resources of those going to Cavite, and ultimately worsens the traffic condition further. As you are probably aware of, this has adverse effects to people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s productivity, resources such as money and time, among other delays such as delivery of goods etc. Attached are some pictures I personally took supporting my report for your information, reference and appreciation of what is the reality. I hope that concerned agencies take this seriously and with utmost urgency so as not to cause further adverse effects to the people, and the economy as a whole.

Please note that the road, upon which your project is going on, traverses the area where usually populated establishments are to be found, such as, the Provincial Hospital, the Airport and Catanduanes State University to name some.\nThe main intention of this letter is to call the attention and bring to the knowledge of your good office and person the many shortcomings or defects in the construction of the above-mentioned project which I have personally noticed and observed in my capacity as a non-engineer person. Such observations are the following:\nThe Road-widening project includes the construction of a drainage system in the form of a line-canal underneath the concrete pavement. However, the drainage system, part of the widening works is so constructed that it avoids as it swerves away from private structures built along the right-of-way portion of the area traversed by the drainage system. As a result, the finished portion of the project appear zigzagging. This observation is best manifested in the following private structures found setting outright on the area of right of way of the project to wit:\n1. Portion fronting Funenaria Bugtong \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the drainage was made to swerve away from the establishment as it passes in front of the funeral parlor. Reports however has it that in the construction of the building of said funeral house, its owner was made to sign a waiver that he is to remove the structure when the government should need the area.\n2. Portions of the total length of the drainage system were constructed inside concrete fences of some residential houses but it left behind the fences untouched negating the very purpose of the project which is to widen the National Road.\nRecently, however, said fences were now removed but leaving behind fences belonging to former Governor Leandro Verceles Jr. and one belonging to a certain Segundo Gianan, both of whom are influential family in this province. As a result, the project is a picture of zigzag pathway alongside the more or less straight national road.\n3. Portion of the Project near and horizontal to the concrete fence of the airport is now completed, but the work left behind a hilly or a protruding concrete pavement not visible from a distance. The uneven pavement makes that portion of the national road hazardous.\n4. Before the construction of present drainage system, there was already an existing open line canal in front of the airport runway. This line canal cater to the floodwaters naturally flowing from the runway through holes at the foot of the concrete fence saving the national road from flooding.\nPresent construction works discarded the old open canal and constructed in its instead a closed drainage system. Consequently, depriving floodwaters its natural flow from the runway to the drainage system. As a result, the highway floods when it rains, which was not the case with the old open canal system.\n5. At the junction of the national road and Moonwalk road, a provincial road, there is an existing lateral drainage system that directs the flow of waters to the open line canal along Moonwalk road. The construction work of the new drainage system disregarded the simple fact that the old lateral drainage system is too narrow in width to accommodate the increased volume of floodwaters that flow under the expanded drainage system of subject project.\n6. Also, because of the No. 5 circumstance, the bulk of the floodwaters will flow directly to the low grounds where the Provincial Hospital and many residential houses are located. This may lead to floodings in said area. It must be noted that the purpose of the lateral drainage canal was to redirect the flow of floodwaters to the open line canal along Moonwalk Road where existing drainage system could accommodate larger volume of floodwaters. Again, this simple engineering factor was evidently ignored.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, we respectfully request your good office to conduct a thorough investigation so as to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings in the implementation and construction of the subject Road Widening Project.\n  \nRespectfully Yours,'"}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20142359", "body": "I would like to know what is the unit of length for the road you have presented in your Road Data.

Sir, my concern is: I have a house in Tropical Heights Subdivision at San Francisco, Agusan del Sur which is fronting the national high way which I acquire through PAG-IBIG loan last 2006. Since then, I maintain the road-right of way in terms of cleanliness and landscaping. Sometime in 2010 before the barangay election, the president of our subdivision bulldozed my road-right without my knowledge purposely to construct a waiting shed and a terminal for motorcycle which I disagree. But they insisted that resulted to a heated-argument.Last, July 4,2013 i was summoned by the barangay official to apper during their session to discuss matter regarding the use of road-right of way with the presence of dpwh engineer. It was clear during the discussion that I am the first priority to use the road-right of way and it is prohibited by the rukles and regulations of the dpwh to construct waiting- shed and motorcycle terminal along the highway even if it is a road-right of way. Sir, I after the discussion in the barangay, the tropical hieghts association president made an appeal to the motorcycle drivers and let them sign a resolution requesting our mayor to allow them to put up a waiting shed and terminal.Sir, the association president said that they already asked permission from our governor and dpwh for the said project which I felt I was left unheard. Is it legal sir to ask permission from our mayor and governor and dpwh for the use of my road-right of way? Hoping for your immediate response regarding this problem Sir! Thank you and more power!

There are a lot of flaws and complaints on this project and workers are just ignoring the residents. The Foreman also is always absent. Please give us feedback and actions on our complaints before the completion or we will suffer heavy floods because of this project. Thank you.\""}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20160461", "body": "Dpwh! Pakiayos pi yung traffic flow sa sta. Fe, nueva vizcaya. Sobrang natatraffic kameng mga dumadaan dun.

I currently work for a company that is located in a private industrial compound named Grand Asia Compound in Sitio Gitna, Brgy. Tatalon, Valenzuela City. For more than 5 years, the road leading to our office is like a dirt road with large potholes. We were informed that since this is a private road, road concreting should be paid for privately. Last year, the few locators in the compound then pooled our resources to fund the concreting of our road with a budget of Php 3.5M. This week however, a contractor named TOKWING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY started breaking our road using a backhoe. They are claiming that this is a project of DPWH to create drainage. There are no permits shown in the work area therefore we do not know what this project covers and the duration of which. There are also no DPWH representative in the area. I would like to verify if this is indeed a DPWH project and if so, what is the jurisdiction of DPWH in a privately owned road / area. I would also like to verify the coverage of the project if it includes the return of the private road to its previous condition which in concrete and how long will this project take. Your reply via email is very much appreciated so I can show and report this to my boss.

In this connection, we would like to know the status of the said Project located in Naga Creek in Pulanglupa Dos, Las Pinas city. To-date, we have noticed a significant increase in the contract amount from the original P5.0M (as presented to our BOD prior to commencement date) to P8.4M which is now displayed in the billboard installed at the project site. We have noticed lately that works at the river wall along the perimeter of Camella Homes 5 Subd has come to almost standstill. We have been informed by site workers that they will soon start work along the Naga Creek wall opposite the Camella Homes 5 stretch and along St Joseph's Subdivision. Also, information we have gathered show that the remaining rehab works (i.e., demolition of old wall and construction of new structure) of the wall along Camella Homes 5 will not be pursued as originally planned. Instead of the original works (which was presented to our Board of Directors before the start of the project), only repairs of the remaining stretch of dilapidated wall will be carried out this time. We will appreciate it if you will kindly enlighten us officially of the current status and the remaining/revised scope of works of the above-subject project. May we just mention in passing that last Sept 19, 2014, heavy rains caused f lash flood at Camella Homes 5 and nearby communities. On that occasion, flood waters rose quickly and fortunately went down quickly too - both due to the unfinished status of the river wall which allowed quick ingress and egress of flood flows from the creek.

Thank you.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Tony Igcalinos <tonyigcalinos@gmail.com>\nDate: Fri, Mar 8, 2013 at 2:09 PM\nSubject: Request for Inspection of Defective Gravity Wall\nTo: luchie.encarnacion@yahoo.com\n\nHi,\nAttached is my request letter to Sec. Singson as per conversation with Ms. Grace Chua. The letter comes with photos, hence the large file size. Thanks,\n\n8 March 2013\n\n\nSECRTARY ROGELIO SINGSON\nDepartment of Public Works and Highways\nFax. No: 304-3020\nManila\n\nDear Secretary Singson,\n\nI am writing (a) to call your attention to a defective DPWH-funded Mapandan Creek gravity wall constructed at our village here in San Juan, Cainta, Rizal, and (b) to request your good office to send your Bureau of Design, or whichever appropriate bureau, to inspect and verify if the said construction conforms to the design standards and if it fully complies with the specifications approved for funding. \n\nThe subject project is under the code 4A0612F00044 as shown on the DPWH website. \n\nTo be fair to the Department and to the PMO as the implementing agency, the construction started on time on the first week of January 2013. As of this writing, the work is roughly 50% \u201ccomplete\u201d as far as our village is concerned.\n\nHowever, on February 22, a Friday, after a three- to four-hour light rain that lasted until past 12:00 noon, the water at the creek rose by about 1.5 meters. As a result, several homes were affected, as well as our backyard, by strong water leaks coming from the newly built gravity walls. A neighbor described a faucet-like leak. A block away, residents had to scramble for safety as the gravity wall at the back of their house nearly collapsed, causing the water from the creek to flood the streets. (Attached here are photos of the breached gravity wall of a property along Swimming St).\n\nWhen workers were piling up rocks at the back of our property, I noticed that they only poured grout after every two-feet interval. A PMO supervisor who visited us on the same day I called\u2014February 25\u2014told me that grouting should be at every 30 cm, or a little above 11 inches of intervals, which is confirmed also by a DPWH engineer from the 1st District of Rizal who I consulted. Another non-compliance to the plan is the use of single layer gabion. The contractor told me that a double-layer gabion is only appropriate to open properties with no structures that may be potentially affected or damaged.\n\nOn February 25, after inspecting our property, I brought the PMO people and the contractor to our Homeowners Association office to discuss with the officers and the affected homeowners possible remedies to our problem. And while the contractor promised to do whatever is necessary, I personally feel that our situation should be brought to your attention for proper cause of action, especially when the contractor could not assure us if a \u201cpalitada\u201d could even plug the leaks and if it can withstand impact and constant battering of water most especially during the storm season. \n\nThe poor quality of construction, I would like to believe, may not entirely be the contractor\u2019s fault as he may just be following what I suspect is a flawed design, and for which I am requesting your Bureau of Design or the most appropriate agency to verify. \n\nOur lives, more than our property, are at stake here. \n\nAfter Ondoy in September 2009 and the Habagat in August 2012, we could no longer afford to live under a constant threat of another flood. While we are thankful that finally our village will be spared from flooding, which is getting worse in recent years, we are dismayed, to say the least, that the construction of the gravity may never grant us the peace of mind that we have been waiting for a long time. We are wrong!\n\nBut what is more serious to me, and to all of us, is the seeming deliberate attempt of some people to shortchange the government by giving us constituents an infrastructure that is designed to fail.\n\nTogether with my fellow villagers, I am hoping for your immediate action.\n\n\nTony D.

Commuters have been suffering from heavy traffic especially during rush hours and also during the months of November to December. But it seems that heavy traffic within Metro Manila is now an all year round occurrence. Our streets are not expanding but our population and vehicles on the road are growing yearly. The project of your department to link the SLEX and NLEX is a very good undertaking and our company fully supports it since we use both toll ways to reach to our client-schools. Last year when several DPWH surveyors marked the site of where to place the posts or supports of the Skyway Stage 3, particularly posts PS3-64 and PS3-65, these posts are marked directly in front of our office lobby and main warehouse garage. As the Skyway Stage 3 project will obstruct our building along G. Araneta Ave it will also obstruct the normal flow of our business. May we then request that the mentioned posts be moved or adjusted in a way it will not impede our normal business operations? We are hopeful for your favorable reply. Thank you very much. JORGE A.

Francisco Duque III, Chairman, Civil Service Commission, Manila\nSir, I am Engr. Gregorio E. Sayson of Poblacion, Talibon, Bohol. Have served this Government in different places in Visayas and Mindanao for more than 40 years. Last March 13, 2013 I retired from the service by operation of law on age 65 compulsory retirement. I retired as DPWH District Engineer of Bohol 2nd Engineering District, Bood, Ubay, Bohol. I am really worried because until to date my claim for Terminal Leave Benefits was never acted upon by the concerned authorities. I am in quandary situation where to go. Yes sir tis is clear cut violation of the CSC MC No. 7 and its implementing Rules and Regulations. Sometime in August 2013 I was informed by the DPWH Region VII, that my claim already forwarded to DPWH Central Office and was eventually submitted to DBM. Since that period I got no more information what so ever. Hence, Im writing this for help. I am one of the victims of the 7.2 magnitude killer quake and the super typhoon Yolanda in Bohol. I am afraid that some of our brothers & sisters in the government are backsliding sa Daang Matuwid.

I am Edna M. Lotho and i would like to complain regarding our sewerage system that the DPWH Blocked.

Mula nung gawin po ang daan namin ito, napansin ko na po na bumagal ang pagbaba ng tubig sa amin C.R.

Sinabi po namin agad sa mga gumagawa na tiga DPWH na nagcecemento ng daan nung mga oras na yon at ang sinabi po namin baka may natakpan na butas na palabas ng sewerage namin. Ito po ang sagot ng tao nyo na foreman daw, \"BUTAS? ASAN? WALA NAMAN AH! Sir/Madm, 48 years na po akong nakatira sa Sta. Ana, ang feeling ko po, ginawa akong tanga kahapon. Sinabihan din po ako na baka sa amin ang problema, yong pong poso negro na pinatignan ko\nrin po sa kanila. May pakikiusap na aking ginawa, dahil ayaw man lang nila kaming pansinin. Sa pagkatingin, at gamit ang aming kagamitan, may bara daw pong bato. Pinatignan ko na rin po sa aming asawa ng kasambahay na naggagawa ng poso negro, yon din po ang sabi nya. May nakabarang bato sa daluyan ng aming sewerage system. Sir/Madam, I did not create this problem, but now the problem is in my hands. Also the answer that your people gave, also added irritation to me. Ang sabi pa po sa akin..tawagan nyo maynilad, sila dapat hindi kami, o kaya yong gumagawa ng poso negro. Sir/Madam, for the past 48 years, matino ang daanan ng tubig namin, nang gawin lang itong daan na ito sa M. Roxas St. Sta. Ana, Manila, nagumpisa ang lahat. PLEASE, I DO HOPE THAT AN IMMEDIATE ACTION WILL BE MADE. Also, i have submitted a letter of complaint to our Barangay Chairman. As was told to me yesterday, she will submit my letter to the City Engineer's office. Again, Sir/Madam, an\nimmediate action i hope will be taken. The fault is not ours,  the fault is with your people. Sana man lang nagtanong muna sila, bago sila nagtibag, kanino po ba ang butas na ito? sa bahay nyo po ba? ano po ba ang magagawa namin para hindi kayo maabala?

I was really bothered and shocked by the fact that the slow road expansion and cementing of R-10 has brought the informal settler back to the partially cemented road (north bound). The news reports are always focusing the worsening road congestion in R-10 by the trucks, but one solution would be to expedite the completion is long overdue and delayed R-10 expansion. imagine, for many years, we are using the south bound lane, while th enorth bound lane, was left by the city govt of manila to flourished and invade the north bound road. Dear Sir/ Madam, the informal settlers are now back in the road you have cemented, why not start opening up those finished parts of the road.? We commuters are so affected by seeing taxpayers money gone to waste. So, now we have to pay again with our taxes those new informal seetlers occupying those roads for them to vacate? Even the local barangays are not doing anything to stop, new shanties sprouting each night. Im so sad and depress, seing these, these very people the informal settlers are the ones, causing the crimes here, th eones causing the garbage piling up. While, we the tax payers, are not even given a chance to have decent roads. I hope you feel our harrowing experience passing these roads, since we dont have any other road as alternate.

Residents here do complain about the rough and muddy road that span of 10+km and pass a river just to bypass the old lumber bridge which is within the jurisdiction of Mun. of San Francisco, but it seemed that people don\\'t trust the Govt. due to rampant corruption from bottom to top officials in the Municipality.

Your commitment to transform the agency into a model of honest and effective service and to save taxpayer money is highly commendable.\nI am writing you because I am concerned by DPWH\u2019s plan to demolish Anda Circle and turn it into an intersection with traffic signals. DPWH seems to believe that Anda Circle is causing congestion. \nIn fact, it is the opposite that is true. Research in the U.S. has consistently shown that, compared to intersections, properly designed roundabouts cut congestion.\n\u2022      The MythBusters test shows that an average of 385 cars can cross a four-way intersection in 15 minutes. In contrast, 460 cars can cross a roundabout in the same amount of time. That\u2019s an improvement of about 20%. \n\u2022      Studies by Kansas State University measured the flow of traffic at intersections before and after they were converted to roundabouts. In each case, installing a roundabout reduced delays by 20%. \n\u2022      Studies by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that roundabouts cut delays by 89% and vehicle stops by 56%.\nAs a concerned citizen, I am asking for DPWH\u2019s justification for the demolition of Anda Circle. What studies and findings justify the use of taxpayer money to tear down the roundabout? \nSecretary Singson, your urgent and immediate action on this request will be much appreciated. As stated in the citizen\u2019s charter of DPWH, I look forward to a reply within 3 to 6 working days.\nPlease email me to confirm receipt of this email. Thank you for your time and consideration."}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20142613", "body": "You are all stupid and incompetent as well as corrupt.

There was even no means for a person to pass, how much more for our 4-wheel vehicle.I talked over the phone with the contractor, Annabi Cagalawan of Cagalawan Enterprises but she said it is not in their scope in the contract.

But now, we cannot pass because the road is too high with a canal-like structure (no culvert or cover to the side) which is also dangerous. The contractor - Cagalawan Enterprises said, it is not their concern since it is not part of the scope of their contract. According to her, it was the neglect of DPWH surveyors. Our entrance is almost 3 meters wide facing the mainroad and there are flaglets to distinguish that it is an entrance and there is a private road going down the hill. The private road can easily be seen since the main road is on the higher grounds. Now our property road is impassable.

Puyat Gil Avenue near Taft Avenue, a cement mixer truck with the plate number URI 663 bearing the placard \u201cDPWH Project\u201d rear-ended the public utility jeepney I was riding. The said truck massively collided with the aforementioned public transport with the plate number TVY 541 that was on a full stop by the U-Turn slot along Sen. Puyat Gil Avenue. Additionally, the jeep I was on which was on a completely halt, subsequently bumped on another jeep in front with the plate number TWF 240.\nAs the closest person to the rear of the jeepney, I have closely witnessed the truck going at us without a halt. As such, I was the first person in the jeepney to have received the collision shock and though I have reacted quickly to throw myself further away from the area of impact, I have suffered a very painful back injury.\nAs the primary witness and one of the victims of the vehicular accident, I can testify with confidence that the DPWH cement mixer truck was clearly responsible and at fault.\nThis injury might be internal and having an existing history of back pains, I have submitted myself into professional assistance for the thought that this would lead to serious complications.\nI am demanding the contracted agency or the department, whoever is responsible for the actions of the truck URI 663 to rightfully compensate me with the personal damages and inconvenience it has incurred upon me. Should a settlement fail to complete within a month\u2019s time this letter was received, I will be pressing legal actions against the truck and the responsible body it is reporting to.\nThis e-mail is being sent for record purposes.

This CATHERINE \u201cKAT-KAT\u201d BENDOY slammed the phone on me while I was making an inquiry last August. It all began when I asked her if she could fax or e-mail a form. However, CATHERINE \u201cKAT-KAT\u201d BENDOY insisted that it is not DPWH policy and told me I have to come to the DPWH-Western Visayas Regional Office to get the form. CATHERINE \u201cKAT-KAT\u201d BENDOY even had the guts to tell me that people who have multi-million peso transactions come over to her office to get the necessary documents. Doesn\u2019t the Aquino administration pushing for efficient and prompt government services and curb the inconvenience to the Filipino people? Transactions can be made via phone, mail or the Internet. I don\u2019t need to go and waste jeepney fare and my time just to get a document that can be sent to me. And besides, financial transactions are made daily via the Internet or via phone. Even international bank transactions are made that way without people flying from one country to another. I was following up on behalf of someone, whom I should say does not want to deal with the bureaucracy of government offices and arrogant government workers like CATHERINE \u201cKAT-KAT\u201d BENDOY. I urge your office to reprimand CATHERINE \u201cKAT-KAT\u201d BENDOY, an arrogant DPWH-6 worker who thinks Filipino people like me are her slave. To remind you and to remind CATHERINE \u201cKAT-KAT\u201d BENDOY, people like me are the ones who pay your salary. I pay taxes. Since CATHERINE \u201cKAT-KAT\u201d BENDOY has the audacity to disrespect a journalist such as myself, how much more of an ordinary Filipino? CATHERINE \u201cKAT-KAT\u201d BENDOY has no place working for DPWH-6 or any government office.

Normally, the CRC is only required in the purchase of tender documents.\n\nI have been dropping bid documents for AARCON at DPWH region. Albay 1st and 2nd districts, DPWH Cam Sur 1st District, DPWH Sorsogon and the BAC there did not ask for the CRC during the bidding.\n\nPrior to the bidding, a man who introduced himself to me as Engr. Ronal said to me in a loud shouting voice \u201cpinsan ako ni Gne. Ronalo! Tao ako ni Congressman Gonzalez! Hndi mo a ako kilala?!\u201d He offered to bribe me, to pay the expenses of AARCON in the preparation of the latter\u2019s bid documents. He told me to wait. I later learned that he was actually Ramos Relato who is the owner of ELKAN Construction. But he did not return before the deadline (2:00 p.m.) for dropping of the bid documents so I dropped the bid documents at 1:58 p.m.\n\nI realized that it was only his strategy to have me disqualified. The bac together with ang relato returned at the BAC pffice at 2:05 p.m. If I did not drop my bid documents because I was still waiting for him I would have been disqualified.\n\nAfter dropping our documents, Relato falsely accuse me of creating trouble at the BAC office and called a CIDG agent to have me arrested. But the agent, after finding out that his allegations were false, left without arresting me.\n\nAt  March 2:45 p.m. Relato together with the BAC employees\u2014Engrs. Edgardo Gosrospe, Marlo Matamorosa, and Jelson Padilla removed the chain and opened the padlock of the bidding box and took out the bidding documents of AARCON Builders.Gorospe told me that Atty. Rodolfo of DPWH Legal told them to do it. So AARCON Builders was not able to participate with the 13 other contractors in the bidding which started at 4:45 p.m. already more 2 and 45 mins of 2:00 officila bid opening time.\n\nI believe that Relato was in cahoots with the BAC employees and Atty. Rodolfo I. Personally saw Relato and his secretary enter and leave the BAC office at will. I also learned later that he was the taker, the arranged winner of the bidding.\n\nMahal na Pangulo, naniniwala po ako sa wagas ang iyong hangarin na alisin ang korapsyon. Huwag mo pong hayaang manatili ang mga tiwaling Gawain sa DPWH. Sana po ay magtagumpay ka sa iyong krusada tungo sa matuwid na gobyerno para makatikim naman kaming mahihirap ng kaginhawaan.

Also, what I think should be a greater priority is the drainage problem in Tunghaan. A little rain and you can see a lot of flooding on the roads already. 2. Why wasn't it scheduled during SUMMER BREAK? I know your agency is capable enough of thinking road constructions should be done in the summer when there's less traffic and hassle. Plus, the sunny weather would help dry and harden the cement concrete. The rains in June-August will paralyze some of the operations for a few hours and/or days, further delaying the construction and the public's misery. So WHY WAS IT DONE NOW (at such an inconvenient time)??? So those were my complaints/feedback. I appreciate if you can respond to my concerns at a sooner time. After all, it is the government's (and its agencies') responsibility to be transparent and accountable of its transactions and doings to the public. Thank you. Rechel C.

Clearly, there has been a lack of planning and research on DPWH side. Why cut the trees if you can build around it? Why can't you save the trees, help the environment and have a beautiful island of trees in the middle to divide the lanes? I have only lived here in New Jersey for 5 years but I have seen how trees and nature in general is a major consideration before any construction is ever made. Of course you'd tell me our country is not like the United States but please, doesn't common sense apply? Have you not known that we, a small country at that contributes a little bit to the rainforest chain----the only rain forest chain on this earth---to benefit of all us living on earth?

Victoria Gregorio, mains office BAC office who has been separated in the service way before the rat plan, she has been working overseas for 3 or 4 years there, then after she decided to go home for good she returned in the service right after the chaos of the rat plan emerging as Project Manager.  Well, as long as I remember she did not avail of anything in the rat plan nor resigned nor file a LOA (clearly its not allowed to be on leave for that long in the government) unless she has an exemption to any other ordinary government employee.  Clearly her case is not because of loyalty with the department because there are dozens of Engineers in her rank that's been sticking their  with brains to their jobs in the dept hoping for a similar place where she is.  Anyway can anybody with authority that can explain how this happens? for the sake of what the Departments advocacy (marangal na serbisyo, tungo sa pagbabago)\n\nMore power and more answers pls.

Good afternoon,\n\nI would like to share an event that took place today in Matalom, Leyte about 10:30am January 28, 2015, that involved a construction project site on the national highway. Unfortunately I was involved in vehicular accident on the site of one of your contractors. Fortunately the accident was not very serious (no loss of life) but I believe this could have been avoided. Before entering the area (the stretch of highway where work is being performed) there were no warning signs. I spoke with some of the residents who live in the area and this was a great concern with them as well because there are a number of children in the area. Another issue was the debris on the highway. The gravel left behind on the road is what actually caused my motorcycle tires to lose traction resulting in the accident, a local resident helped me and picked up my motorcycle and moved it out of the traffic lane on the highway. I spoke with several different drivers (PUJ and Tricycle) today and they complained about the same problems. After the accident I called my husband and told him what happened and to come to the scene. After my husband arrived, the driver of one of the trucks placed one yellow warning triangle about two meters behind the trailer of his truck which was parked about 10cm away from the highway lane itself. An action such as this shows the driver of the truck knew he was wrong so he quickly put the warning device out before the manager arrived. A few moments later the manager and his assistant arrived. I must say I was surprised at the way they spoke to me, not only did they start to speak aggressively and loudly at me they also angrily told me how wrong I was about them putting warning signs out for the other drivers on the highway. Not one time did they ask if I was ok or showed any compassion even though I was standing there bruised and bleeding. They treated me as if I was beneath them, not worthy of speaking to them and offended that I dare ask them about warning sings. I called the police to come for my safety because of the hostile behavior of the manager and his assistant with the backing of the construction crew. My husband asked why there were no warning sings placed and why did they not remove the debris from the road, the assistant said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is the Philippines, not America\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I could not believe he said that. I am a Filipina proud of my country and countrymen, his statement suggests that because we are Filipino we are somehow inferior to Americans, as if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to follow rules, I do not share his opinion of my country and my people, I sincerely hope the DPWH who employs this contractor does not share his opinion either. I asked the manager to put warning signs out then he said to me \\xe2\\x80\\x9csee you in court\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as he walked back to his truck. Shortly after the police arrived and I explained what happened. The police officer agreed there should be warning signs in the area for approaching drivers he also mentioned the debris on the road. The police officer asked the manager about the debris (gravel and mud) on the road and he said they did not put it there even though they have the only construction equipment in the area. I drive this stretch of highway two times every day as well as many local drivers, we all say the same thing, the debris from the road is obviously from the construction site, it was not there before they started the work here. After the police spoke to them they agreed to put warning signs on the highway and the assistant manager said to the workers \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmen at work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while laughing and poking his index finger into the palm of his other hand which we know to be an obscene gesture. Today is a day that truly saddened me, to be treated at a level of disrespect that is absolutely unwarranted and unacceptable in any circumstance especially from a company contracted by the DPWH which is a part of the government of the country that I love. I sincerely hope the DPWH does not condone such behavior from its contractors and will take proper steps to ensure their contractors treat our fellow citizens with dignity and respect that we all deserve. Thank you for your assistance and God bless.'"}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20142153", "body": "Good day, July 31, 2014, nagbungkal ng daan ang dpwh region 3 dito sa Jose Abad Santos Avenue (JASA) AKA olongapo - gapan road. sa may boundery ng Bacolor at City of San Fernando.

They have a depot in the area West of Mira Verde Avenue and North of Del Carmen Street, with exits to both of these roads. This morning, Mira Verde was covered in mud.

Therefore, isn't it the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the wheels on the trucks are cleaned of mud before they go on the roads? 2) Shouldn't DPWH supervise the actions of its contractors to ensure that they don't deposit mud on the roads? Please advise what action you will take to solve this problem.

We would like to request that our 6 meter national highway bridge in Solano, Tanauan, Leyte, be repaired at the earliest time as it has been almost one and a half years since it was destroyed by the Super Typhoon Yolanda. At the moment, alternate route is being used by residents of Tanauan and the nearby towns Dagami and Burauen. This route is through the Tanauan market using the almost more than 50-year old Embarkadero bridge, and the \"newer\" bridges along the diversion road of Tanauan, Leyte. As the Embarkadero bridge is almost older than us, we fear that what happened to Hiagsam bridge in Jaro, Leyte could happen to our Embarcadero bridge considering the additional load, of all commuters and vehicles small and heavy ones alike, it is subjected to since after the Yolanda destruction. We believe Embarkadero bridge is also even overdue for check up and maintenance repair. I reckon DPWH is also concerned of depreciation of its infrastructures. We witnessed that there had been work started on the repair of the Solano bridge but it seemed to have been abandoned long before its set completion date of February 20, 2015. There are materials such as hardened cement, steel bars and boulders left at the site. There are already rumors bordering on SOP and corrupt officials concerned on the repair of said bridge. I, however, choose to still count on the honest and concerned service of DPWH, all its officials and employees. It is with this fervent hope that we pray to see that this request merits your prompt and able action as we were informed the request for budget is already at the DPWH Central Office.
