On the 19th Century Spanish adobe Masonry at Que-anuang Bridge, we petition the DPWH to save the surviving portions of adobe bricks by altering the bridge's design to let people see this masonry as historical relic. 2) to spare the almost 100 year old Municipal Cemetery of Sariaya from road widening. It was a silent witness to the courage and valour of Filipino Guerillas fighting against the retreating Japanese forces of the 1945 liberation. This Municipal Cemetery of Sariaya will become dust of Oblivion if we just remain silent. 3.) to save the tomb of Briccio O. Reynoso, he was a Quezon Medalya ng Karangalan Posthumous Awardee, the first and Only Quezonian that ever represented the Province of Quezon in International Competiton. 4) to save the 100 year old Kalachuchi Tree and several tombs dating as far as the year 1910 for Ecological and Historical reasons, respectively. They were silent witnesses to the unfolding of Sariaya's History; they are important icons of Sariaya's heritage and history.

Morning commute for a 2km road means 45 minutes for us, early evening going home to Magalang is basically the same, vehicles slow down, because of roads that were paved but now full of holes and uneven pavements. not to mention that it becomes a big drainage because of lack of sewage drain to the bridge. Have pity on the ordinary commuter - students who have to wake up earlier than usual, workers, market goers, etc. It is not enough that they fill it with gravel every time; accidents caused by sudden stops on potholes and motorcycles weaving in and out of traffic are a daily sight. They say that there is a future expansion or upgrading for that portion of the road, but when will it be, we suffer everyday. at least maintain it for the moment Please help us with our predicament, a neglected road that close to a city and to the NLEX does not look well.

Halos isang linggo matapos ilathala ng Angono Rizal News Online (aRNO) ang dalawang taon nang nabibinbin na tulay sa Darangan, personal na pinuntahan ng aRNO kaninang Huwebes ng umaga, January 21, ang munisipyo ng Binangonan upang kunin ang update, ang kanilang pahayag, at para sa patas na pag-uulat ukol sa developing story na ito. Partikular na pinuntahan ng aRNO ang Engineering Department pero wala umano ang otorisadong magsalita ukol dito. Hindi rin pinapasok ang aRNO sa nasabing opisina pero may dalawang staff dito ang kumausap sa aRNO sa lobby. Humingi ng pahintulot ang aRNO sa babae at lalaki na staff para makuha ang kanilang pangalan para sa ulat na ito, pero tumanggi sila. Ayon sa dalawang staff, maging ang Pamahalaang Bayan ng Binangonan ay nababahala sa mabagal na paggawa sa tulay na proyekto ng DPWH Region IV-A. Ayon pa sa nakausap ng aRNO, ang dahilan kung bakit hindi pa rin natatapos ang tulay ay dahil sa hindi pa rin umano natatapos ng Manila Water na ayusin ang mga tubo at daluyan ng tubig na maaapektuhan sa paggawa ng tulay. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMasikip din kasi yung lugar kaya hindi nagkakasya ang mga malalaking equipment na kailangan para sa paggawa ng tulay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wika ng nakausap ng aRNO. Ang paliwanag ng dalawang staff ay halos katulad din ng comment ng isang mambabasa ng aRNO sa nasabing isyu. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTinanong ko yung kaibigan ko sa DPWH (kung) ano nangyari dyan sa tulay. Delay daw yan kasi bukod sa pinakamasikip na tulay daw yan sa Binangonan na part ng widening project eh ang tagal umaksyon ng PLDT MERALCO at Manila Waters. Hirap daw heavy equipment dyan kasi nakadikit sa residential at commercial building pero tentative date daw ng tapos nyan eh sa February or March. Naka-fabricate na yung part na ikakabit daw dyan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wika ni aRNO reader Edmund Dantes. Nang tanungin din ang staff sa nasabing opisina kung matatapos ngayong taon ang tulay, hindi naman ito tiyak na nasagot ng kausap ng aRNO dahil depende nga ito sa ikikilos ng Manila Water at DPWH Region IV-A. Samantala, sa Martes ay pupunta ang aRNO sa DPWH Region IV-A sa opisina nito sa Quezon City upang kuhanan sila ng update at pahayag.'"}, {"category": "10", "id": "CFMC-20142282", "body": "Procurement Service  extended excellent service in terms of \ncompetency of staff.

I am writing to ask your office to look into the project of Congressman Dan Fernandez of the First District of Laguna (who is also planning to run for the position of Mayor of the City of Santa Rosa, Laguna)and to put a halt to it until further investigations and safety checks have been carried out. Mr. Fernandez has embarked on a project to construct a concrete wall on the south riverbank of the Silang-Santa Rosa River, which puts the residents on the riverside at risk of severe flooding and potential collapse and destruction of their houses. This project was planned without consultation with the residents of this city, and construction has been going on for the last month. It was temporarily halted when the river flooded and overflowed on December 19, 2015, and the scaffolding that had already been built for the construction of the wall collapsed and was damaged. Work on the project resumed last week. From the construction workers\\' remarks and seeing the current scaffolding, the height of this planned wall will be higher than the height of the original south riverbank: this, in effect, cuts the width of the river by at least 30% and narrows it considerably. In the event of heavy rain or another typhoon, the volume of water that gets dumped into this river becomes enormous. With the width of the river reduced by 1/3 following construction of the south riverbank concrete wall, the potential for this project to make matters worse has been more than compounded. In the light of the severe flooding throughout the city that happened most recently when the river overflowed above the south riverbank on December 19, 2015,we can foresee that this project will cause the water level to rise above the original riverbank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s height and lead to foreseeable damage and destruction of the homes bordering the north riverbank, and flooding of the roads, especially Gov. Feliciano Gomez St (which parallels the river) and Arambulo and Anonuevo streets (which are perpendicular to Gov. F. Gomez Street). When the flood water level in the river rises above the riverbank and batters the walls of the homes built along the north riverbank, these houses walls will eventually collapse. In our case, the bedroom where my bedridden parents lodge (aged 89 years and 93 years, and incapacitated by multiple strokes) is located right beside the riverbank on the north side. If the floodwaters rise, the water will overflow above the window of their bedroom and flood the bedroom. Evacuating them to a safer place in time of this foreseeable emergency is going to prove to be a challenge for their 2 caregivers. We foresee that the whole house will be inundated with floodwaters following completion of this concrete wall on the opposite side of the river. Our house is sturdily built and has stood on the same site since 1966. Our grandmother\\'s ancestral house was built by our grandfather in 1935 and has withstood 8 decades of typhoons without suffering any damage. They are at high risk of being destroyed as a consequence of Mr. Fernandez\\'s inadequately researched public project. The other homes along the riverbank which lie west and east of our parents\\' and grandparents\\' homes are constructed of more flimsy materials and are much smaller, and bound to take a much harder hit and be more easily damaged or destroyed. Mr. Fernandez newly constructed \"house\"/campaign headquarters lies on the other side of Gov. Feliciano Gomez Street further east, and is constructed on higher ground with high concrete walls, and is unlikely to be at risk of flooding, unlike ours and our neighbors\\' houses. While the reasoning behind this project may have been well-meaning and well-intentioned, the fact remains that this project has been undertaken without the necessary engineering assessments (or maybe, or with utter disregard for them). Construction is currently continuing. There have not been any public announcements nor discussion regarding this project, and no attempt to liaise and inform the residents of the extent and potential consequences of this project have been made. Because of the imminent danger and considerable damage to person and property it threatens to bring, we are therefore asking you to look into this matter urgently and halt construction until a public forum and investigation have been carried out. \n\nVery truly yours, \n\nDr. Melissa Jeanne P. Batilando \nEngr. Emiliano Joel P. Batilando, Jr. \nEngr. Jose Melvyn Glenn P. Batilando \n\nOn behalf of our parents: \n\nEmiliano R. Batilando, Sr. \nGliceria P.

We were then inform that funds were not available to implement the whole project so we have to wait for funds.   The untiring wait seems to no avail because the missing link of the road now has been filled up from time to time but it made the condition worst because they filled it up with sandy soil.

Singson: I am Mr. Ricardo Fian, a resident of Albuera, Leyte. Our property are among those that will be affected by an on-going road-widening project being implemented by DPWH District Office at the Poblacion. The project involves the widening of the National Road stetching from Ormoc City passing through the Municipality of Albuera, down south towards Baybay City.But the construction activities is being started now at the Poblacion of Albuera, Leyte. What causes apprehension and confusion among the residents of Albuera, and specially those living along the said road subject for widening, is that the extent of the road-widening reaching to as much as 10 meters from the center on both sides of the road, is so wide that houses and properties along the way are in danger of being demolished. This is as if the volume of vehicles passing through this road is as big as that in big cities! And what is worse is that the project engineer of the DPWH District Office in the province (or in Ormoc City) said that owners of the properties that will be affected by the said road-widening project will not get paid. That is why he, the project engineer, is prodding the affected residents to VOLUNTARILY demolish their respective properties. By this alone we could sense something fishy in the implementation of this project. In addition, we would like also bring to your attention, Honorable Secretary that this project was implemented without even conducting a public forum or public consultation with the local residents regarding the project. That is why residents here now are very disappointed because of this lack of transparency of this project, knowing that transparency and accountability in projects is now being stressed by the present administration of President Noynoy Aquino. That's why, Dear Secretary, we are appealing to you to first put on hold or stop this project. Our municipality, a coastal municipality, is so small and is in fact just a third class municipality. Its land area is even getting smaller now (and in fact is getting smaller everyday)because of typhoons and the big waves that are constantly eating or washing out our coastal land areas. If the project would push through, so much space would be eaten up for the widening of the road, while areas for residents whose population is increasing at a fast pace, would be so much diminished. If indeed the district office is very sincere in its project and considerate with the residents of the very small town proper of Albuera, why not instead push for the construction of a diversion road that would run through from Ormoc to Albuera and to the next City, Baybay City without crisscrossing the inside portion of the small town proper of Albuera. This way our very small town, Albuera, who is not yet even fully recovered from the destruction wrought by typhoon Yolanda can be preserved and saved. Thank you Mr. Secretary for giving us this communication line where we will be able to reach you to air complaints and appreciation for your office. I will appreciate it very much if I can get a reaction from your end on this information, complain,and appeal from you so that I can relay it to my town mates and hopefully for us to be rest assured that something positive will result. Once again, thank you and Mabuhay. Respectfully yours, Ricardo A.

We are on the problem in passing these rough portions of the road especially when transporting our farm products to the market. Some senior citizens living in this area wanted to go the church could go to because of the difficulty to travel on the rough portion of our road. Concreting of these portions of the road is the only solution. With regards to these problem, can you help us for funding on the concreting work for the above farm to market road?

I told the one I talked to, whose name escapes me, na sana ayusin yung warning at isipin ang safety ng lahat ng gumagamit ng kalsada. \n1. Kapag galing ka sa loob ng Metroville palabas sa Ma-a Road, MALAKI ang posibilidad ng aksidente dahil blind ka sa mga sasakyan na galing sa kaliwa na mabilis ang mga takbo. Ang warning na nilagay ng mga tauhan ng construction or ng contractor ay immediate sa ginawang semento. Wala man lang ample warning sa mga motorist at sa galing sa Subdivision. Para bang nag iimbita ng aksidente.\n\n2. Ang drainage contruction sa entrance ng Metroville Subdivision \u2013 Hindi pa ito sinesementuhan hanggang sa ngayon. Tapos na ba ito o hindi pa? Temporary lang ba dahil kailangan pang ayusin? Ang mga tambak ay unti unti ng nalalagas at hindi na pino ang pag approach papasok at palabas ng Metroville. Pangit na po ang quality ng temporary na tambak. Humiling po ako na sana ayusin man lang para hindi naman ito sagabal at madaling makasira sa sasakyan.

A number of people died during Ondoy (2009) and Habagat (2012/2013) and this is not a light matter, not a joking matter at all. We are located in one of the more elevated areas in the village but the water level during Ondoy was up to the roof. Our family driver drowned (and died).

I have been a resident of Talayan Village since the 80s. Please, we beg you, not to worsen the flood situation. Hold off construction until you alleviate flood concerns, widening of waterways, etc. I looked it up and this project is worth 20+ billion pesos. I don't think it is too much to ask to include the safety of the people that will be affected by your construction. The hassle and dirt of your construction we could live with as long as your project will not aggravate the flood situation. Whenever it rains, I almost can't sleep because of worry.

The contractor - Vicente T. Lao Construction (VTLC) has not made any substantial progress since they started the project during the last quarter 2014. From November 2014 until May this year, the Siocon River had very shallow waters due to the occurrence of drought, which would have been the right time for the contractor to fast-track the project. But for a long time, they managed to construct only a platform for their crane, which at this time, serves as a choke point of the swollen flood waters of the Siocon River. The platform, now constructed halfway of the river's width, acts as an obstruction to the free flow of water, which would cause a backflow, overflow the riverbank, and eventually inundate several low-lying barangays. For this reason, this representation - the designated MDRRMO of Siocon - earnestly request intervention of DPWH to direct the contractor for the immediate deconstruction of the dam-platform to prevent potential disastrous flooding of the municipality. We will be submitting a report to DPWH Regional Office, cc: Office of the Honorable Secretary.

Singson\nSecretary\nDPWH\n\nThru:\\tThe Regional Director \n\\tDPWH-Region III\n\\tSan Fernando, Pampanga\n\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am an employee of this department and I am also a concerned citizen wherein a very traumatic experienced had happen to us during our return back to Manila from the Province in Lamut, Ifugao.\n\nLast April 12, 2015 at around 2:00 AM we were halted near a police station before the city proper of San Jose City because of the ongoing road construction on that area. The traffic situation on the area was observed to be heavy and that kilometres of motorist were already piling-up until such a traffic aide advice light vehicular motorist to divert to a local road wherein telling us that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a short cut to reach San Jose City. Traversing more or less 700M  there was a temporary signage made of plywood an arrow left and markings of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTO SAN JOSE CITY\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Traversing again around 300m more or less an arrow left sign again, until we reach a certain rough road and there was a traffic aide letting us cross a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbox culvert\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in an irrigation canal then a concrete road, after around 200m there was a junction, an unnoticeable gravel road and the continuity of the concrete road. The motorist ahead of us followed the concrete road and we also followed. Traversing a combination of concrete and gravel road until we observed that we are already climbing a newly graded gravel road. I am already apprehensive because the terrain becomes winding and   seeing lights downhill believed to be San Jose City proper. Back of my mind reasons, that we were on the right track because of the effort that it was recently graded for the convenience of the motorist rerouting.  Until we are halted because motorist ahead of us stop. Thought it was due to traffic again. But I was already alighted because why we are in the middle of nowhere and in a roadway on a mountain side. We already wonder why it took so long that the motorist ahead us moves, until we received relayed messages of drivers ahead of us that no more road to traverse, that it was a dead end.\n\nThis time, I panicked, I was nervous, cold feel creep on my nerves, I rattled because of the thought that we were lost in the middle of nowhere and that it is almost 4:00 AM. What about if there were nice people around that might notice we were lost and that the thought of bad things might happened. Until we decided to turn around.  \n\nIf only there were enough traffic signages and traffic aide in every junction of the road to guide motorist especially it was dark not even street lights to guide us. It was a horrible and traumatic experienced and even me an employee of DPWH had to undergo these very traumatic experienced because of insufficient and lowly traffic management. I know even those who experienced the same fate that we have might curse the people who were responsible of what they have undergone/suffered.\n\nI hope this could be an eye opener that traffic management is very important in a road construction notwithstanding that there is a pay item on this on the Program of Works.\n\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n\n\nELEONOR C.

After I submitted that report, I left it to the Lord whether or not my report would deserve attention from a huge government office like yours and decided to forget about it. Today, Feb. 5th,at 3:00 p.m. (my Divine Mercy hour), a representative from the DPWH NCR Port Area office called up that he had to see me, well, perhaps to investigate my accident. So I gave him directions to my home. I welcomed Mr. Rafael Santiago, DPWH Records Officer and his companion driver, Mr. Francisco Romaguira. Frankly, I did not know what to say or do after Brod Rafael informed me that DPWH indeed received my complaint and request for assistance. And to top it all, handed me an envelope and said that the contents came from his office mates and friends who learned about my plight. That it was a form of \"ambagan\" which would help out in my needs for medical attention in view of the accident. I therefore take this opportunity to thank each and everyone of you who have shared a part of your treasures to help a senior citizen like me who met an accident.

The highways are always populated by palay being dried, kuligligs, and tricycles. There was even a trip I took to Bulacan where vehicles are forced by barangay traffic enforcers to go through one lane with traffic being alternated because a whole stretch of one lane of the road was full of workers sifting through the palay.\n\nThe DPWH should do more than plead: they should impose. They should use the powers of the police to enforce the existing laws about obstruction and the like. Heck, the DPWH should work with the DILG and fine and sanction LGUs who cannot enforce order in their respective jurisdictions regarding this issue.\n\nAlso, I thought people in the provinces are supposed to be more polite and more considerate compared to those from Manila. Yet, common road courtesy seems to be non-existent in the province! \n\nImagine coasting along at a good 60-70 kph going to Ilocos. You then come across a tricycle doing 25 kph. You try to overtake but can't because of the continuous traffic on the opposite lane as well as many lanes occupied by drying palay and cordoned off with large rocks. You honk your horn politely to signal the tricycle if it could move over to the right a little bit towards the shoulder so you can overtake safely and be on your way. Imagine seeing the tricycle driver (usually a young lad in his teens) look back at you and then look forward and act as if you don't exist and ignore your \"excuse me may I pass please\" honk. Imagine this goes on for the next 3-4 kilometers before you finally get a safe chance to overtake. Imagine this get repeated on the same trip dozens of times. \n\nI suppose it is easy to justify why motorists have come to have such low regard for these undisciplined blokes.\n\nMr. President panahon na po para itigil ang kultura ng pagbibilad ng palay sa mga daan dahil ilang buhay na ang nasayang, wag na po nating hintayin pang madagdagan pa ang masasayang na buhay. \n\nMaraming salamat po at sana masulusyanan na ang matagal ng problemang ito."}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20160437", "body": "This was a perfectly fine road.

I apologize for not being clear, when I mentioned the warning signs, I was referring to the batching area where the construction vehicles were entering and leaving the highway. I appreciate the DPWH communicating with the contractor about being respectful to the public.

I am not sure if this is the same company that you contracted but I hope that you give this the attention it deserves.

It is just so happen that the original document will be coming from Manila and so an advanced copy were faxed as the original will be sent via parcel delivery. Sir, I would like to ask for your attention in reviewing the performance of Ms. Evangaline C. Manalo, Accountant III. She is the Head of the Accounting Unit here in DPWH \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5th LED. Among all the officers and staff working in this noble institution, Ms. Manalo is the exact opposite of them all. It is so easy for her to curse at any person whom she finds lower than her position in office. I was one of those lowly people she has raised her voice with as she pointed her finger towards me, scolding me, accusing me and saying so many things that were not part of my purpose of being there. I tried to talk and ask around with other people whom like me, being a Liaison Officer, processes billing collections from licensed contractors with regards to what they can comment about Ms. Evangeline Manalo and we all shared common observations and experiences about her, among them were: - Very unaccommodating - Tactless, curses at people naming them with very unpleasant words - Humiliates other people with rude and degrading remarks - Always frowning and very unfriendly - Unprofessional with her actions as well as with her words - Capricious and very fickle minded - Uncooperative and very difficult to approach Even the people working in DPWH 5th LED can also attest that Ms. Manalo is the most difficult person to work with. I pray that you would give ample attention on this matter sir. And if it is possible, I would greatly appreciate it if my name would be held with discretion when you consider and look into her work ethics. Thank you so much, God Bless and more power to you.

What I'm referring to are the annoying 'barricades' along the national roads in front of almost all the government elementary schools here in Sorsogon province. People say that these help in preventing road- related accicents in front of schools. But these schools are already equipped with brightly painted pedestrian lanes and pedestrian safety warnings. And despite these,and despite the presence of barangay tanods in front of almost every school, who help kid cross the road, the barangay tanods are very industrious and faithful in putting these 'barricades' that make all these roads in front of schools 'one- way'. As if this is one of the duties of the barangay tanods- most of these 'barricades' are left there even when the students are already in school, so that the B. tanods can leave their posts in front of school and probably do something else.

Likewise, the installed safety barricades/provisions are dangerously inadequate so much so that said stretch of road construction is virtually \\xe2\\x80\\x9can accident waiting to happen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. 2.0 Inadequate installation of visible and informative road signage along Naga Road and in nearby affected roads. Such signs should clearly inform all commuters/affected stakeholders where to enter or pass and if possible, the time/day/period where such restrictions will be in effect; 3.0 Contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negligent work practices in breaking road pavement and excavating the roadway where the drains will be installed has resulted to at least three incidents of Maynilad Water supply mains being busted; 4.0 Information, Education and Communication (IEC) efforts to inform residents of Camella Homes 5 HOA, Dna Paz HOA, Dna Julita HOA, and nearby HOA/communities of the impacts to traffic and pedestrian/vehicle access of the construction activities related to the Project should be extended to all HOA around or near the project site. A public briefing for affected communities could be made soonest at a venue near the project site like in Camella Homes 5 or Vergon Ville covered gym for this matter. (OVER) 5.0 Contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incorrect installation of drainage mains in at least 2 locations (actually observed along Naga Road in front of Camella 5 subdivision) where the existing Maynilad Water supply main line was made to directly intersect and pierce through the concrete drain pipe instead of the Maynilad Water line passing under or over the drainage pipe. This practice is blatant violation of best engineering practice and construction standards. 6.0 The wrong construction method for installation of drainage pipe that allows Maynilad Water supply main to \"pierce\" the concrete pipe - a violation of construction specs & methods for utilities.

Your department gave us a lot of headaches and loss of money. I don't know if you planned this city wide projects but, from what we experienced your agency is and still disorganized. We dropped off my kids in Don Bosco Sta Mesa and it will took me an hour and half before I reached my office in Pasay City. Can you expedite and fast track your repairs? It seems you are trying to show off to the public that your agency is doing a fine thing job. Well, it's not! I think you better count the number of commuters who cursed your workers because of your massive so called road and drainage improvements. Don't tell me to leave early because the school opens at 6 am and my wife and I are working from 8 am to 5 pm. I have to dropped her off in Pasong Tamo, Makati City first before heading to Pasay City. We are always late since last week because of your agency and so called projects of improvements! Do what is best finish the project the soonest. Is there any money involved that leads to corruption that's why this repairs are taking so long? Is it a red tape from the City of Manila agency? Your agency doesn't have any concerns to the public and commuters! Remember all roads in Sta Mesa and Sta Ana are being wrecked and sad to say there are few labourer spotted in the site. You have also to consider that these roads leads to schools, hospitals, wet market, bridge and churches and should be a busy street that need to fasten up the completion of projects! I just hope that you will take immediate action on my complaint and if not, then the image I saw in your agency doesn't change since time immemorial...bulok pa rin sistema! Sana lang walang issue sa corruption na puwede maging dahilan nang pagka delayed!

Seymour Sotero, Engineer I of this office,Kagawad Victor Saplit and Barangay Tanod Ronnie Willy of Poblacion Tuba on July 4,2014 to verify if our project, Road upgrading (Gravel-Paved) along City Limit-Sto. Tomas Road,K0262+429-K0263+600, Kabuyao, Tuba Benguet contributed to the contamination of the Amliang Creek. The following are my observations and findings, to wit;\n\na) Water Impounding system (WIS) # 3 (Stage 3) of the Baguio Water District (BWD) which was the 1st WIS we reached along our way. Its source coming from a spring and water along a small creek flowing towards Amliang creek. (pls. see attached pictures).\n\nb) WIS #3 connects and flows towards WIS # 1 (Stage 1) and from this stage flows towards Km. 8 (Filtration stage).\n\nc) According to news, said WIS #3 was previously contaminated due to the loosened soil from the private road opening project that compelled the BWD in filling a case against the concerned people responsible to the effect. (pls. see attached pictures and map)\n\nd) As we proceed along we reached WIS #2 (Stage 2). Its source is coming from a spring and water along a small creek flowing towards Amliang creek. (pls. see attached pictures).\n\ne) WIS #2 has two (2) sub- WIS a & b wherein sub WIS #2a connects and flows towards WIS #1 (Stage 1) and the other directly flows towards Km.8 (Filtration Stage). (pls. see attached pictures).\n\nf) WIS #1 (Stage 1) source of water comes from a spring only and flows towards Km. 8 (Filtration Stage). (pls. see attached pictures).\n\ng)The distances of these WIS # 3,2 &1 apart are 301.99 meters and 213.63 meters respectively. (pls. see attached pictures).\n\nh) Our project is located at the other side of the mountain slope from these said Water Impounding system of the BWD so therefore is impossible that loosened soil from our project contributes to the contamination of it.\n\ni) Earth are being hauled-out from the roadway excavation activities of our contractor although some soil that fell down the mountain slope are unavoidable due to soil erosion along the roadway caused by heavy down pour of rain and needs immediate attention in order to have the road opened to traffic for the public. However, the project engineer assigned thereon constantly reminds and issued site instructions to the contractor instructing them not to the dump earth down the mountain slope. (site instruction and pictures are attached herewith).\n\nj) Besides the three (3) stages of Water Impounding System previously mentioned, there is a Hydro Plant of the BWD located at Camp 6 Barangay. During the rainy season, the source of water of this said hydro plant are Amliang, Bat-og and Kamading Creek but these creeks are dry during the summer moths while other sources comes from spring water located near it (pls. see attached map). The distance of the mountain slope below our project from the BWD Hydro Plant is approximately five (5) kilometers away. Rainwater flowing with contaminants ( Animal waste, chemicals used as pesticides in gardening and small scale mining,etc.) from the tip of Amliang Creek downstream during continues heavy rainfall will contribute to the contamination of the Hydro Power Plant. Water flowing downstream with loosened soil will clear for a long period of time especially if it has a longer distance similar to the mountain slope below our project from the BWD Hydro Power Plant compared to the distances of soil erosions occurring naturally at the mountain slope and the small-scale mining wherein these are located nearer the BWD hydro plant.\n"}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20151869", "body": "This pertains to the 24 August 2015 letter of Mr. Edgardo Del Rosario of Brgy.

The main concern here is the health of the residents within the community where the project is being implemented. The pungent smell of the sewer is unbearable. We even had a case of two infants (age 1 and 2 years) who suffered from respiratory problems, mainly because of the smell of the dirty waterways. Let me ask.

Malauan, This is regarding the installed concrete barriers along Mc. Arthur highway in the City of San Fernando, Pampanga. These concrete barriers pose great danger and hazard to motorists especially at night although reflectors are mounted on them, they are not enough for drivers to clearly see. Several accidents have already happened in the past few weeks along these said barriers and as of today (April 27, 2016) another accident took place infront of the Iglesia ni Cristo - New Era University where a truck headed northward to Angeles City rampaged the concrete barrier and crossing head-on the opposite lane.(Pls see attached pictures) This is not the first time that such accident happened in this particular area. I am respectfully addressing this perilous situation to your good office for a possible immediate solution to the problem in order to avoid future fatal accidents.

As member of RPMC, I joined the monitoring and noticed that mangroves were cut to complete the widening and concreting of the national road in Barangay Cagban, municipality of Cajidiocan in the province of Romblon. We were informed that the mangrove clearing and cutting were coordinated with your concerned office.\nI understand the predicament of DPWH and the need to address road inundation in the area as the highway crossed a mangrove forest. Be that as it may, all mangrove forests in Sibuyan is protected and in fact an initial component for National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) under Presidential Proclamation 2152:\n\"Upon recommendation of the Director of Forest Development, duly concurred in by the Minister of Natural Resources, and pursuant to Section 18 of Presidential Decree No. 705, I, FERDINAND E.

What is the formula and conditions agreed upon by your office and DPWH?\nAs Sibuyanons, we are glad that the said road is efficiently constructed according to accepted standards but we are still concerned on what needs to be done to avoid further cutting of trees and mangroves \u00a8C or else, concrete ways to replace what had been cut. We are further concerned, as well, that a number of trees are gradually being cut to complete the widening and road construction in Barangay Mabini, San Fernando, Romblon.\nI hope for your kind and immediate action on this matter."}, {"category": "6", "id": "CFMC-20142523", "body": "Updates regarding to the implementation of Flood Control project in remedios.\n"}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20151100", "body": "DPWH SAPANG PALAY SAN JOSE DEL MONTE nkakatrafic kau sa pnapgwa nio ng daan.Pangit ng plano nio.nkkabwisit kau ng mga tao sa pgpasok. sapang palay san jose del monte.the schdule of your contractor if you start last week of march the horizontal project is already done.2months vacati(on)'"}, {"category": "1", "id": "CFMC-20151778", "body": "This pertains to the message received by the Contact Center ng Bayan of the Civil Service Commission relative to the delayed payment of wages of the Job Order personnel of the Cordillera Administrative Regional Office, the details of which are stated therein.

Dalawang beses na po itong napaTELEBISYON at kinukondena ang mabagal at hindi matapos tapos na construction ng nabanggit na tulay. Marami napong aksidente ang nangyari dito at apat na pong katao ang namatay at ang huli nga po ay nitong nakaraang linggo na nahulog sa ilog ng ginagawang tulay ang isang tricycle dahil nawalan ng kontrol at namatay ang isang pasahero nito. Nagagalit narin po sakin ang mga mamamayan sa nasabing barangay dahil bakit hindi pa rin itinutuloy ang construction ng tulay. Naniniwala po ako sa tuwid na daan na tinatahak ng pamunuan ni Pang.

Please refer his complaint to the right department for corrective action. Thanks and regards... Gilbert From: Mike Jose <donpmj@yahoo.com>; To: jose gilbert <gilbertjose@yahoo.com>; Cc: Jose Carlo <cmfjose@gmail.com>; Subject: Contractor made flooding Sent: Sat, May 30, 2015 1:50:20 PM Dear Sec Singson, I am writing your good office to complain about the carelessness and insensitivity of a contractor doing drainage improvement work on Gen Luna near the corner of Padre Faura Ermita manila. There was a thunderstorm on May 30, 2015 in our area at around 9pm lasting for more than 30 minutes. This caused flooding in front of our house and even caused water to enter our garage which has never happened in the last 38 years of our stay in the area. The contractor FLORDES CONSTRUCTION AND TRADIMG CORP excavated Gen Luna St dumping all the soil at the side of the road covering all the storm drains and gutters thus preventing the free flow of water. The soil created a dam in front of our house thus this problem of flooding and water entering our garage. It seems they failed to notice Gen Luna's elevation is higher from the corner of UN Avenue and rain water goes down towards Padre Faura and on to Taft Avenue. Also the street level is already higher than our sidewalk therefore the tendency of water to go to side of the road where the gutters and sidewalks are. We have never had water logged like this in front of our house in the 38 years that My wife and have lived here. Not even Ondoy did this to us. It's only during the night of May 30, 2015 that this occurred due to the carelessness of the contractor Involved. In fact water had entered our garage and as of 930pm last night it was 5inches away from having water coming into our home on the ground floor level. Good thing the rains stopped preventing water from entering our ground floor level. Sad to say I talked to the foreman of the contractor in the morning of May 30th and told him about our concern and the possibility of this happening but I was told that the excess soil will be hauled away during the day. Well apparently they did not do so. my wife and I had to clean out the sidewalk and the inside of our garage of mud and water in the morning of May 31st. Two senior citizens having to do this all because someone did not pay attention and failed to consider the implications of their actions. We would appreciate if the proper department could be informed of this situation and if the contractor can be given instructions to correct the situation immediately and for them to avoid dumping soil in front of our house to prevent another occurrence of this problem. As long as the excess soil from the excavation remains there, the threat of flood water entering our garage and home will be there.

Rogelio L Singson Sir, It was in the year 2011 when the good secretary with much pride told the DPWH employees that He is giving twenty thousand pesos to the BEST performing office, Ten Thousand pesos to those who performed BETTER, 5 Thousand to those whose performance are considered GOOD and none to those who did not make it to the grades. GOOD - BETTER \\xe2\\x80\\x93 BEST. Parang PUSOY. The C N A incentive Bonus during that time was agreed upon by the union and management at 20k. The employees then would want the reward be given to them across the board since what we do here in this agency is a team effort and the grading of offices is too subjective that only those who are close to the powers that be might receive the awards. And so it went. Comes now the disallowance made by the COA, who usually has been a recipient of C N A incentive bonus before the term of Secretary Singson except in 2011 onwards. The disallowance was based on a DBM Circular providing a ceiling of 25k to C N A incentive bonus of employees which was made known to all agencies in September, 2011. This DBM rule is like changing rules in the middle of the game. The C N A incentive Bonus before September 2011 shall be based on the savings and the general provisions stating the priority in the use of savings of the GAA for the particular year. Suddenly the DBM ceiling. PUSOY TALAGA. Me panggugulang pa kasama! The irony of it all, the good secretary also requested that the usual 10k we receive from the office of the president every Christmas be slashed to 5 thousand so we can help the victims of calamities during that year. As far as I can remember it was the Typhoon Pablo that brought destruction to the people of the Southern Philippines. But the slashed Christmas Bonus became permanent. And now since 2011, we have a Christmas bonus reduced by half permanently. Then this secretary was claiming that he is very generous to the employees of the DPWH... Double jeoparfy. Our xmas bonus was reduced by 5k per year. And already 4 years hence. We were robbed of the Christmas bonus and still you want us to refund! Have the honourable Rogelio L. Singson any notion of the Net Take home pay of the DPWH employees? Did the secretary realize that most of the employees here are receiving less than six thousand pesos a month after deducting GSIS, Taxes and Loans from various financial institutions?'"}, {"category": "6", "id": "CFMC-20142726", "body": "dear sir, \n\nplease help us here in V.V .COUNTRY HOMES CAINTA RIZAL,,,\nmaraming ripraps damaged by typhoon mario but until now wala pa action office nyo at na-report ko na po sa inyong engrs, sa mangahan pasig office at palagi ko follow up pero hangann ngayon po wala pa rin action.. almost every day ay binabaha kami pag tumaas na ang tubig sa creek at pumapasok na sa mga streets kasama ang mga putik.. like now malalim\nna naman ang baha dito sa amin... basta bumuhos malakas na ulan\nbaha na agad... sana po magawan nyo agarang solution ang conditon namin dito.. umaasa po kami na bibigyan nyo ng attention ang aming conditon dito ..\n\nthanks and God bless...

I am grateful that DPWH in our area is conducting road widening for the betterment of our city but I am also displeased with the way things go around. Part of the said project is the widening of roads from Ulas-Calinan, Davao City, District 3. This is more than a comment and it is more likely a complaint. Part of the widening project is to create good water drainage system (riprapping as we commonly say it). Engineers and Contractors contract people to work for them in piling boulders and reinforcing them with concrete cement. There is 10-15 meters(estimated)long riprap work to be finished in each contract. According to the workers, they were disappointed with the compensation system with regards to finishing their job. Their contract rate is higher than what they actually had received after the job. My point here is, how will they be able to find fairness and equality with regards to this? In each contract that they have to finish right away, they only receive 600 pesos/week. How is that even possible? How much does the government spend for the project then? Is this how things happen in the what we call good governance? How come you pay those workers lesser compensation than the average workers? In our area, the minimum wage for each average worker is 200-350. Thats just for the average workers. Lets say its a contractual rate. How come you only pay them 100 pesos or so each day? Do you think this situation creates trust? No it creates anger and fury. Its like the government is cooking us with the same oil we produce. Isnt it possible to implement system that hard/utility workers have to be paid much than those who SIT and decide? Yes people tend to be poor because of lack in education. But thats not the reason why they will receive less than 50 percent of what the average wage they should have. \"right project, right cost, right quality, right on time\"? is that what you really mean? \"Daang matuwid, Kaunlaran ang Hatid\"? Kaunlaran nga ba? How poor the governance really is. You should say, change should start in each person..how come? when most of your people dont do so. Useless. Please address this to your contractors and people behind the construction of the roads and highways. Remember, we are grateful with your projects but we are not grateful with the things that happen behind your back. One thing, your contractors say that those citizens who had their properties dismantled due to road widening shall be paid accordingly, whats the truth about this? Many citizens say these contractors are liars. How come they promise and ask the citizens to keep Clearances as part of the requirements in the payment and yet nothing happened in the end? Should we call you liars too? Whats the truth behind this? I am afraid that one day the table shall turn. Lapses are too many.

I live along access road in Loakan, Baguio City. Almost every year I notice that roads along Loakan Rd. are always rehabilitated even if they are in good condition, not withstanding the fact that Access Road which is only several meters from the main road, badly needs rehabilitation. Nasasayangan po ako sa sinisirang cemented roads considering na yung kalye namin ay puro potholes at ang drainage system ay misyado ng silted.I have always believed that the Aquino administration uses funds wisely and I hope your Department can allocate funds for the rehabilitation of Access Road, which is parallel to the Airport's runway. Pag umulan po ng malakas ay baha na po ang daanan. Several times we use our own resources to clean the drainage but we can only do so much as private citizens. I hope Mr. Secretary, you will find it in your heart to do something about our road. We have brought this up with our barangay, but they told us that this is under ATO and DPWH. We don't know anymore where to bring up the concern that is why I am writing this letter as my last recourse.

This road (after 13 years) was finally repaired and surfaced in 2012, except for the last three kilometres or thereabout going toward the Dumanjug boundary. Pocked with so many potholes, this stretch is the worst road part of the road, and yet this seems to have been deliberately neglected. Question: Why?\n\nSorry, but I and many people here in south Cebu are more than fed up with the \"Road Maintenance Program\" of the Department of Public Works and Highways! We, taxpayers, have to make additional expenses for new tires, shock absorbers and time-consuming vulcanizing of punctured tires, etc. Yet, just 10 meters away, in the second district (Dumanjug), the national road has been twice ot thrice tarmacked (in 2011 and 2013), though in all instances the so-called maintenance work was absolutely unnecessary. \n\nWhat a mess and lack of organization!

I just would like to complaint about 2 things, first is the regarding the lights along the EDSA-Ayala Tunnel and same with EDSA-Shaw tunnel. I have noticed that ever since the EDSA-Ayala tunnel was completed, it did not have sufficient lighting inside the tunnel. Same goes with the EDSA-Shaw tunnel, which according to MMDA lights are only turned on during night time. We all know that road safety is everyone's top priority. But in this case I don't think we are putting it on top of our list. Tunnels are really dark in reality, daylight will be very impossible to enter it. That's why we need to install ample lights inside. Motorists should be able to have clear vision inside the tunnel. And should not be required to open their respective head and tail lights. Please install ample lighting in both tunnels since it has been dark for a long time already. For the safety of the motorists passing the tunnel everyday. Secondly, I have noticed that the Philippines has no standard traffic law or traffic signs being used. Why can't we have just one standard law that can be easily understood by the motorist. So everyone is guided by that law. Signages play an important role in the countries traffic system. If we have uniformity in our signages, motorist can easily identify the road rules and regulations. Local Government should follow DPWH laws and not have their own. This adds to the confusion of the motorist. If we have different ordinances in every city. All of us should just use and follow one system. Let me know how I can be of help in solving the long problem of our country. And that is our traffic system.

Your response was a real surprise just meeting one week later, two of your employees inviting me for a clarification to my problem with the local watercompany in Tacloban City, LMWD, in charge for Palo-Leyte. Today I had the clearing talk with your local representative of DPWH, Mr. Ramon Bibero, in Tacloban City, district one. Mr. Ramon was informing me that DPWH has nothing to do with the local Water-Company LMWD who is in charge of our water supply. Furthermore he could make a very helpful telefon call to LMWD for speeding up our water connection to the mainpipe in our brgy. Cabarasan Guti, a service that had be paid some two month ago. That is why I want to appologuize my mistake that your department is not in charge for delivering the water for the people. And it was my mistake writing to a wrong adress. But anyway I want to thank your for the help we got from you, to listen to our furthermost infrastructure problems with watersupply in the brgy. Mr. Ramon Bibero did a very helpful job in finding a good solution and response, and we are very grateful for the work you do for just normal people like we are and also thanks to all your people from DPWH in district one of Leyte, who really take care for the public. That is why we can see forward now, for a good infrastructure in future, also in our brgy. that was almost 100% devastated by Taifun Yolanda just two years ago.

Engring Office DPWH NCR, 2ND Street, Port Area, Manila Today is a most blessed day for me. The Good Lord Above never abandons His children, especially those who cry for help. He did answer my cry! On January 15th I reported thru this DPWH Feedback form that I, a senior citizen, met with an accident at the SM Sucat Mall while flagging a ride for home. After I submitted that report, I left it to the Lord whether or not my report would deserve attention from a huge government office like yours and decided to forget about it. Today, Feb. 5th,at 3:00 p.m. (my Divine Mercy hour), a representative from the DPWH NCR Port Area office called up that he had to see me, well, perhaps to investigate my accident. So I gave him directions to my home. I welcomed Mr. Rafael Santiago, DPWH Records Officer and his companion driver, Mr. Francisco Romaguira. Frankly, I did not know what to say or do after Brod Rafael informed me that DPWH indeed received my complaint and request for assistance. And to top it all, handed me an envelope and said that the contents came from his office mates and friends who learned about my plight. That it was a form of \"ambagan\" which would help out in my needs for medical attention in view of the accident. I therefore take this opportunity to thank each and everyone of you who have shared a part of your treasures to help a senior citizen like me who met an accident. Words are not enough to express the appreciation I feel for your generosity. Nag-uumapaw po ang aking puso sa inyong kagandahanng-loob. Sana man lang na-meet ko kayo personally para mapasalamatan naman. Kaya dito na lang po, sa inyong lahat, mula kay Brod Rafael Santiago at Kiko Romaguira, MARAMI PONG SALAMAT DPWH NCR!

San Vicente and Brgy. Calendola here in the City of San Pedro, Laguna. This is in order for us to determine the actual load limit/allowable load limit of the said bridge. The said bridge had undergone repairs on the previous months of this year. After the repair we had asked for the load limit specifications in order for us to limit passage of Buses and big cargo trucks and to avoid over loading thereby causing damage in the future. But up to this date there was no official communication  from concerned government agency that will address this concern. We are also in constant communication with the Office of the City Engineer of San Pedro but they cannot provide us with the needed information. They are also waiting response from your office.\n\nLet me just brief you of the Geographical location of the said bridge. This is strategically locate as the entry and exit points of the upper barangays of the City of San Pedro, the Province of Cavite passing thru the town of General Mariano Alvarez and an alternate road going to Daang Hari. Any damage that will occur in the future will greatly affect mobilization of the populace passing thru San Vicente/Calendola Bridge.\n\nOnce again in behalf of the people of Barangay Calendola and other concerned motorists and commuters catered by this bridge, May I personally ask for your immediate assistance in addressing this urgent concern.\n\nMore power and GOD Bless,\n\n\nHON.

What irritates most motorists is that these portions are practically the busiest portions of the urban area part of the national highway in Puerto Princesa City, if not for the entire Province of Palawan.

Singson;\n\nWe are writing to respectfully seek your intervention and appropriate action with regard to certain concerns of our homeowners' association. We have a number of matters that we wish you can give preferential attention. Allow is to enumerate them:\n\n1. The U-turn slot under bridge along ARaneta Avenue beside SM Centerpoint (SM City Sta. Mesa) area is not properly utilized because of the presence informal settlers. While that portion can be allocated to service public transportation vehicles and help ease traffic, it is put to waste and is now an area of riverside settlers that contribute exceeding to flooding. The informal settlers dump their garbage on the waterway beside the bridge which causes flooding in the area during rainy season. We are also worried that in the event of an earthquake, the lives of the informal settlers under and beside the bridge, who have used the U-turn slot as residence, will be put at great risk. \n\n2. The middle street traffic island along Araneta Avenue, between Bayani and Palaza  Streets, has already been repaired. However, since the height is way below the standard height of middle traffic islands, some people easily placed rocks beside the island in order for tricycles to pass thru it and at the same time also paved the way for vehicles to make an illegal U-turn instead of going further to the designated U-turn slot. This poses a big danger for motorists and pedestrians. \n\nWe we request, that since there was already a height adjustment of the Araneta Avenue center island from the corner of E. Rodriquez to Bayani St., the height adjustment be continued further up to the corner of Palaza St. This will certainly avoid accidents and maintain a smooth traffic flow along this major thoroughfare.\n\nIt is hope that you can give preferential attention to the abovementioned in order that they can be corrected at the soonest possible time.\n\nThank you and more power.\n\nTruly yours, \n\nFor the ARANETA EAST HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC.

Grabe ang ginagawang reblocking dyan sa Javellana st., Lapaz, Iloilo city. maliban sa napakabagal, wala pang order ang pagkagawa. Na-notice po namin na inumpisahang sirain yung daan noon pang mga 1st semester ng nakaraang pasukan 2013-2014, halos hindi ginawa ito noong summer at nag commence lamang sila uli nang mag-umpisa na naman ang 1st semester nitong pasukan 2014-2015. At ang masama, di pa natapos yung naunang portion ng kanilang reblocking, dinagdagan na naman ang pambabasag dito malapit sa eskwelahan ng WVCST kaya lalong nagkabuhol-buhol ang trapik. Di ba naisip ng mga contraktor na ito, ang epekto sa mamamayan, nale-late ang estudyante sa umaga at na-e-estranded naman sa hapon pag-uwi dahil maagang gumagarahe ang mga dyip dahil sa trapik. Sa pagkaka-alam ko, lahat ng project ng gobyerno ay may timetable at dapat naka post yan on-site sa lugar kung saan ang proyekto, pero dito wala kaming nakikita, kaya iniisip namin na baka pagana-gana lamang sa contractor kung kelan nila gustong gawin ito. Ako po ay nagtuturo sa WVCST at medyo may kapansanan sa paglalakad, masyado akong apektado dahil hindi ko kayang makipag-agawan sa pampasaherong dyip at kelangan ko halos mag taxi araw-araw, at baka yung konti kong kinikita sa pagtuturo ay mapunta na lamang sa pamasahe. Sinulat ko na po ito dahil ini-expect ko'ng mag ta-tatlong sakay na ako sa simula nito semester dahil sa panibagong reblocking na inumpisahan ng contractor nitong proyekto. DPWH tuparin nyo naman po yung motto nyo \"Right Project, Right Cost, Right Quality, and Right on Time\" dahil kaming mga empleyado nagbabayad naman ng tamang buwis at nangangailangan ng kapalit na tamang serbisyo galing sa ahensya ng gobyernong katulad ninyo.

I've been wanting to send you an email about something, it's just that when I get to the office and do my daily work, I forget about it.\n\nIt's just a blessing that I saw this email from you and I remembered.\n\nDon't want to sound like I'm complaining but this matter bothers me everytime I pass by the area while commuting to and from work daily.  Actually, it's the uncemented road portion along the Litex-Payatas Road.  Coming from Rodriguez (Montalban), Rizal, the uncemented span is before the Km 25 QC marker and probably within or after the Km 24 portion, though I wasn't able to see a marker with the Km 24 QC sign.\n\nMost portions of the Litex-Payatas Road average 4 lanes - 2 lanes on each side (going and coming).  However, due to the uncemented portion, that span there only has 2 lanes used by vehicles traversing the area as the uncemented portion is used as parking space by garbage trucks and other vehicles probably of nearby residents.  At certain times, this portion becomes the bottleneck during rush hours and there is heavy traffic.\n\nAlso, with the occasional rains happening the past days, the road area near the GK Village there, particularly the one sloping down is flooded with rainwater and takes some time for the water to subside.  If heavy rains persist for several days, the area is not passable for small/ light vehicles.  There obviously is a problem with drainage in the area.\n\nHope these concerns can be checked and the proper remedies can be done.\n\nThank you for your attention on the matter.\n\nHave a meaningful Holy Week!  God bless everyone!\n\nRosan\n(Rosanna Eusebio-Baroa)\n\n\n--- On Tue, 26/3/13, Pilorin, Elizabeth P. <pilorin.elizabeth@dpwh.gov.ph> wrote:\n\nFrom: Pilorin, Elizabeth P. <pilorin.elizabeth@dpwh.gov.ph>\nSubject: [DEVCOMNET] FW: DPWH NEWS [1 Attachment]\nTo: \"DEVCOMNET@yahoogroups.com\" <DEVCOMNET@yahoogroups.com>\nDate: Tuesday, 26 March, 2013, 8:46 AM\n  \n[Attachment(s) from Pilorin, Elizabeth P. included below] \n \nNEWS RELEASE\nPublic Information Division\nwww.dpwh.gov.ph\nPlease refer with MS. BETH PILORIN, Chief-PID 304-3280\n26 March 2013\n \n \nDPWH CITED ON ITS PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES\n \n          The Department of Public Works and Highways received the highest Performance Report Rating among all national government partner-agencies of Millenium Challenge Corporation which presented their performance report during the biannual Public Governance Forum held recently. The DPWH is one of the pilot government agencies subjected to performance governance system adapting the Balanced Score Card rating.\n          The award called, Trailblazer Award, is given to participating agencies or units in the public revalida based on significant progress in the agency\u00a1\u00a6s initiatives and scorecard. Last year, the DPWH has also received the \u00a1\u00a7Governance Excellence Seal,\u00a1\u00a8  again the highest rating among participating government agencies, for its outstanding progress under its good governance program and an unwavering commitment to reform in the Philippine public sector.\n          According to Institute of Solidarity in Asia, the DPWH has demonstrated the organization\u00a1\u00a6s continued determination to institutionalize good governance and deliver breakthrough results. \n          The DPWH garnered a rating of 9.08 out of 10 of its revalida report presented by Secretary Rogelio L. Singson before a group of panelists headed by Mr. Rex C. Drilon of Institute of Solidarity in Asia which also included Dr. Alexis Acacio of the University of the Philippines -Institute of Civil Engineering, Ms. Charie Villa of ABS-CBN, Ms. Marivic A&ntilde;onuevo of Millenium Challenge Account \u00a1V Philippines, Mr. Lito Madrasto of the Philippine Constructors Association, Dr. Henry Basilio, President - Research, Education, and institutional Development Foundation Inc., Mr. Edwin B. Villanueva, Chairman - VFL Advisors Inc. (a financial consultancy firm), and Mr. Mario Jose E. Sereno, Executive Director - Association of Petrochemical Manufacturers of the Philippines.\n          Secretary Singson reported on the DPWH performance on paving and upgrading of national roads, construction of permanent bridges, implementation of major flood control projects on major river basins, and other significant gains in its good governance and anti-corruption reforms under the \u00a1\u00a7Daang Matuwid\u00a1\u00a8 policy agenda of the Aquino Administration.\n          In his message, Secretary Singson \u00a1\u00a7firmly believes that while the DPWH continues to transform itself into a results-based government agency under a new era of good governance, the agency never wavered from its focus of delivering the right infrastructure needed to sustain the country\u00a1\u00a6s economic development.\u00a1\u00a8\n \n \n__._,_.___\nAttachment(s) from Pilorin, Elizabeth P.\n1 of 1 File(s) \n 26 march2013-pgs.docx\nReply via web post \nReply to sender \nReply to group \nStart a New Topic \nMessages in this topic (1) \nRECENT ACTIVITY: \nVisit Your Group \n \nSwitch to: Text-Only, Daily Digest &#8226; Unsubscribe &#8226; Terms of Use &#8226; Send us Feedback \n.\n \n__,_._,___"}, {"category": "5", "id": "CFMC-20143032", "body": "Naaksidente kami sa madilim na tulay boundary ng Macabling at Balibago Santa Rosa Laguna dahil walang appropriate warning device.

I am writing to your office due to the following concern: 1.national highway clearing along surigao-agusan del norte road (alegria road section) 2. urgent clearing/removal of our residence fence that is under our patented land and been there since 1979. 3. informal notice since we did not receive any notice from the requesting team from DPWH. Sir/Madam: i have a video record of our conversation/meeting between the DPWH personnel and our mayor and municipal engr. though i don't have an idea where to attached the said video as our evidence of the said informal meeting. they just ask our presence at instant in order to discuss the said road clearing according to the office of engr.Henry Cruz J. Marapao together with engr. edel pejan of DPWH surigao city. to give you an idea our land is along national highway and is a titled private residential land (we have all the legal documents that will prove our ownership and we paid our taxes regularly advance most of the time and we never miss a single payment since we owned the lot and our house been in this land since early 70's around 1973-1974 though we owned the land years before the construction of our house. and our fence in this said land been constructed since 1979 meaning it is not covered yet in the said Road right of way for the national highway. According to our municipal mayor dominador esma jr. that he will claim portion of the land as covered in the Road right of way for some and future LGU's development in the area covered within 15 meters from the center of the national highway to our land/house and according to the group of Engr. Henry Cruz J. Marapao and Engr. Edel Pejan that they will claim the 15 meters with or without our approval since it is covered to the 15 meters.the only affected part is our fence but it is a high-end type of fence. we will obey whatever the government required as long as it is covered within the EO no. 621, s. 1980 amended EO 113, s. 1955. all we ask is that since our fence and our house been built before this Executive order, we allow the DPWH to demolished our fence granting or an exchange that the DPWH will build the same structure after the 15 meters RROW in your/DPWH own financing. but according to engr. Maraparao and Engr. pejan of surigao del norte DPWH their office will not going to finance the reconstruction of our fence since there is no appropriation given by the DPWH national office and i guess they are talking about your office. they are too harsh in explaining things that is why we did the same gesture to them. all we ask is to have some legal basis to know if what they are saying is true. because corruption is very rampant now a days among our government officials and some other LGU sector. the other point is why is it the project of clearing only affects portion near our area? why not like surigo city that everyone is covered and affected? it seems that this DPWN employees will insist that our area will be considered as one of the first batch for demolition. why not start at the boundary of agusan del norte and surigao del norte just meters away from our area? if in the event that what the surigao DPWH engrs been saying that you will not pay for the reconstruction of our fence is true, please give us some government guidelines/executive orders/ and our a copy of approved program of work in order for us to make sure that the said program of work is executable in all areas in the same year baka kami lang dahil hindi kami bomoto po sa aming mayor ngayon. and quite frankly we smell some politics involve in this project? bakit kami lang apat na pamilya lang po ang first e demolish bakit next year pa ang iba? we are hoping for your immediate answer of this matter since we are afraid that the demolition from DPWH people will start anytime soon that is what they told us yesterday. thank you for your time mrs. eden\""}, {"category": "4", "id": "CFMC-20150528", "body": "Kindly justify the disparity in width of the sides/shoulder in the widening project along the Maharlika highway in Sorsogon.The sides are too narrow in Juban but very wide in Casiguran!

For lack of people to do jobs that were vacated by \"eo 366 affected employees\" the hiring officers of this department are flooding the central office with job order employees. a. Job order employees are usually relatives, neighbors or persons that came from the province of DPWH Officers with influence to HRAS (hiring personnel/group.) b. These job order employees are doing jobs of regular plantilla positions and are qualified for said positions. Most of them CPA's and engineers. These give them undue advantage over new applicants who have no relations or connections to HRAS and other hiring officers. c. They are actually being groomed for the positions vacated by the \"eo366 affected employees\". d. Job Order employees are not given personal benefits because according to management alibi, there is no employer employee relationship that exist between DPWH and job Order employees contrary to the activities from a to c above. Being thecase our employees union cannot act on their status as of this time. 2. Citing management's reasons to hire Job Order employees which is the 'lack of persons to do jobs vacated by the \"eo 366 affected employees\" The regular employees are not being allowed to work overtime. Worse, the brilliant bureau directors are not moving a finger to pay ovetime work already done by the regular employees at the height of \"eo 366 affected employees\" claim for compensation when activites in the central office skyrocketed. Even affected employees who were supposed to have terminated their services were still working up to the early part of february, 2014. The above concerns are a threat to the management - employees relationship and are the acts of a few are jeopardizing the well meaning implementing rules and regulations regarding EO 366.

Pati na rin po ang mga drainage system dito na napaka-importante dahil industrial zoning po dito sa aming kinatatayuan pero wala pa nga pong drainange system ang aming locality. May mga factory na nagtayuan na po dito pero ang main problem nila ay ang drainage ng local na pamahalaan....kaya ang mga kapitbahay ng mga factory na ito ay mga nagrereklamo dahil sa kanila po napupunta ang tapon ng tubig ng mga factory na ito....dahil wala nga pong drainage ang gobyerno. Ang maganda po sana ay kung gagawa ang gobyerno ng mga karsada ay makapal na kasama na rin ang drainage at walkway o pathway na daanan ng tao....ganito pong gumawa ang Japanese government....sabay-sabay na para wala ng problema....hindi yung puro partial ang gawa. Pwede nyo po itong i-suggest kay Presidente. Sana po Secretary ay mabigyan nyo ng agarang solusyon itong mga hinaing naming ito.

Incident Report 149;\nI could understand that there may have been difficulty in getting information on the drivers' licenses but why were there no plate numbers and a description of the vehicle damage?\nThe \"initial root cause analysis\" mentioned \"driver's error\". I believe that the preparer of the report should have been more specific on this. What was the error of the driver? Who was the driver who committed the error?\n\nThe \"recommendation/comments/actions taken\" mentioned \"always drive in condition\". What does this mean?\n\nThe incident report did not mention anything about the lack of or existence of road safety measures along the site of the incident. I think that this is an important part of the report. This information will guide on what to do in order to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. Is the road section provided with adequate signages and road markings and road markings? Is the curved section already provided with chevron signs?\n\n2. Incident Report 150:\nIn the information box for \u201c Plate Number\u201d, it is written \u201cmotorcycle not identified\u201d. Was there no plate number on the motorcycle?\nIn the information box for \u201c Vehicle Damage\u201d, it is written \u201cInternal and External Damage\u201d. What does this mean?\nSimilar to the Incident Report 149, I believe that the \u201cinitial root cause analysis\u201d is inadequate\nThe recommendation/comments/action taken\u201d also mentioned \u201calways drive in condition\u201d. What does this mean? The incident report should mention something about the lack of or existence of road safety measures along the site of the incident, not just stating that there was no obstruction.\n3. The pictures attached to Incident Report 149 showed a number of disturbing and/or gruesome images of the victims. Please be careful in disseminating these pictures. We may be being disrespectful of the privacy of the victims or we may be offending the sensibilities of some of the readers to whom you send the repot. I suggest that you do not send the gruesome images with the report but just say that you have pictures related to the report that may be disturbing to the reader and if the reader would want to see the pictures you can send them through another email or  communication with the condition that the pictures be treated with confidentiality.\nYour prompt response to this letter is most appreciated.\nThank you.\nVery truly yours,\n\nRodolfo L.

Tiling, Cauayan, Negros Occidental papuntang bayan ng Cauayan. Sa nasasakupan ng Brgy. Tiling ay may binungkal na dalawang maliliit na tulay na kung tutuusin ay hindi umabot sa sampung metro (10 meters) ang bawat isa. Ito ay sinimulang bungkalin at isara sa trapiko halos mahigit isang taon na ang nakalilipas (more or less). Naging sagabal ito sa daloy ng trapiko sa bahaging ito ng National Highway dahil sa kawalan ng tamang bantay. Isa pa sa nagpalala sa sitwasyon ay ang kasalukuyang kalagayan ng mga tulay na ito na ayon sa aming pagmamatyag ay may ganitong problema: 1. Kawalan ng tinatawag na Project Information Board na naglalaman ng petsa kung kalian inumpisahan at matatapos ang proyekto, pangalan ng contractor ng proyekto, kabuuhang halaga ng proyekto at lugar ng proyekto; 2. Sabay na binungkal at isinara ang dalawang tulay at sabay rin na hindi ginagawa; 3. Kawalan ng nakaduty na mga \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlagmen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d na magbabantay sa mga paparating na sasakyan at magkontrol sa trapiko; 4. Kawalan ng mga warning device kung gabi na maaring maging dahilan ng mga di inaasahang aksidente; 5. Sa mahigit isang taon na pagsara sa mga tulay na ito, at matapos ilagay ang mga kongretong poste, nawalan na ng nagtatrabaho; 6. Kawalan ng mga equipments na magpapadali sa pagtrabaho \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nagkaroon ng heavey equipment, sira naman at yon lang ang tinatrabaho ng iisang tao sa tuwing kami ay dumadaan Sa mga dahilang ito, nais naming isangguni sa inyong Opisina, bilang tagapangasiwa ng mga proyektong katulad nito ang mga sumusunod: 1. Kailan maipagpapatuloy ang pagtrabaho sa mga tulay na ito? 2. Kailan matatapos ang proyektong ito? 3. Bakit walang nakapaskil na pangalan ng contractor sa lugar ng proyekto na sa alituntunin ng Department of Public Works and Highways, bawat proyekto ay dapat nakalagay ang pangalan ng contractor? 4. Bakit kailangang sabay na bungkalin at isara ang dalawang tulay kung di naman pala sabay na gagawin? Bilang mga mamamayan na palaging bumabaybay sa pangunahing kalsadang ito, nais naming maisaayos ang mga ito upang mawala ang mga agam-agam ng naming sa kinauukulan. Hangad naming ang inyong agarang aksyon sa reklamong ito. Sa bawat araw na dumaraan, pumapatak ang pera na taumbayan sa mga proyektong ito. Sana naman ay makita ng taumbayan na tunay nga na ang buwis na ibinabayad namin ay napupunta sa tamang proyekto at hindi sa nabubulok na poste, kinakalawang na mga bakal, renta sa sirang makinarya at bayad sa mga taong walang ginagawa.

I suggest that the government must have a proper cleaning of the overpass and it must have a hole in the sides to avoid stagnant water or other ways that are more effective to avoid such problem.

Singson;\nOnce again, we bid you greetings from Cebu!\nAfter the moratorium on the construction of flyovers planned for Cebu City, the Movement for a livable Cebu (MLC) had the opportunity to shift focus and rallied our limited resources towards the advocacy for comprehensive planning, and participating in various efforts that contribute to making and ensuring a livable Cebu. However, this new focus was suddenly disturbed last October 15 by the unexpected insistence by Citizen Raul Del Mar in the Cebu City Development Council (CCDC) quarterly meeting to revive the flyover projects once again. \nHis rationale for adding this item on the CCDC's agenda for the day was the fact that he had signatures from 49 Barangay captains asking for reconsideration of the previously \"dropped\" flyover projects in an earlier CCDC meeting, notwithstanding the fact that the said flyovers are not in their Barangays. Furthermore, please note that since that meeting, there have been nodevelopments technically or otherwise that would warrant reconsideration. In addition, we have seen no efforts by Citizen Del Mar that led to his various constituents to reversing their earlier anti-flyover sentiments. \nWe find it disturbing that despite results that showed the ineffectiveness of flyovers at specific junctions, the continuing moratorium your department has imposed, the decisions of the CCDC and the city government which dropped the flyover projects and the clamor from the population for projects that the city needs immediately (like flood control, livelihood projects, housing, medical care, etc.), citizen Del Mar keeps on insisting in pushing his agenda. \nWe are happy that the CCDC did not flinch and include the flyover issue in the last meeting\u2019s agenda. However, this will once again be included in the next meeting scheduled for around the beginning of December.\nWe are grateful for your continuing moratorium on flyover construction until the proper studies and consultations have been made. We have not made it a secret that we at MLC would only consider the flyover alternative (among others) if it is a part of the comprehensive development plan that we so need right now.  \nPlease accept our gratitude and appreciation for your listening to all stakeholders including civil society, and for your firm conviction of proceeding only after thorough technical analysis, comprehensive consultation and respect for the laws of the land.\nGob bless you and your staff.\n\nVery truly yours,\nSigned:\n\nTERESA D.

They have all sorts of questions for me, and as their teacher, it is my job to give them sensible answers. Or help them find these answers. An interesting question that has pervaded our recent discussions is how there's always reconstruction going on in our roads. Let me simplify everything, exclude emotions and angst, and just humbly ask these questions to you of which I expect answers for. We'd rather hear it from you, OUR DPWH. 1. Why do we keep on digging and reblocking our roads (for me, I always get caught in traffic in Munoz Edsa, and today there's another ongoing construction)? I don't really know anything about engineering- but these roads/lanes look perfectly ok- I drive breezily on them. Please enlighten me as to why you have to do it. 2. If we've been reconstructing seemingly fine roads, WHY NOT reconstruct the ones which are in a much worse condition (I mean, really bad)? Take EDSA in front of Trinoma (uneven roads for crying out loud, too uneven an infant could notice it) for example, or Cubao. Don't they need much IMMEDIATE repair? 3. I know you've been reblocking all year round, but how come in Manila (Abad Santos, Rizal Ave), most road works are happening now- further aggravating the traffic situation, what with the start of classes and the rainy season. I really have to ask, WHY? 4. How come some road works remain idle (you don't see anyone working on them or removing the orange cones even if they've been dry for a while. Yes, they're dry- it's been a week)? This case doesn't help us. It pains us, motorists, and it makes us mad. As I hope you could tell, I am a concerned citizen of this country, and I could bet that I am one of the most disciplined citizens this country has today. With that, let me claim my right to know about the answers to the questions above. I highly expect the answers from you as you proclaim that you're a department we can reach. I thank you in advance.

SINGSON\nSecretary\nDepartment of Public Works and Highways\n\n\nKay Secretary Singson:\n\nMagandang araw po sa inyo.\n\nAko po, isang empleyado ng inyong departamento sa nakalipas na halos apat na buwan, ay sumusulat para iparating sa inyo ang aking hinaing dito sa loob ng inyong pinamumunuang departamento.\n\nNais ko lamang malaman ninyo ang bulok na sistema ng pagproseso ng pagpasahod sa mga katulad kong Job Order na mas kilala natin bilang J.O. \n\nPara po sa inyong kaalaman, ako po, at lahat nang mga J.O. dito sa DPWH ay buwan-buwang kinakapos ng pera sa dahilang lagi pong delayed ang aming mga sahod.\n\nSa mahigit pong apat na buwan pagtatrabaho ko sa DPWH ay ni minsan hindi pa ako tumanggap ng sahod sa tamang petsa (A-kinse o Katapusan ng buwan na nakasaad sa aking kontrata).\n\nMaiintindihan ko pa po sana kung maantala ng isang linggo ang perang tinatanggap ko bilang kapalit ng aking pagtatrabaho, ngunit madalas po ay umaabot ng tatlong linggo na delayed ang aking (ng halos lahat ng J.O.) sahod. Kami po ay istriktong sumusunod sa kanilang sistema at nagpapasa kami ng tamang papeles sa tamang oras.\n\nPara rin po sa inyong kaalaman, ngayon po ay iba na ang sistema ng pagpapasahod dahil kung dati ay mano-mano at sa cashier pa kami kumukuha ng cash na sahod, ngayon ay naka-ATM na Hindi ho ba dapat mas mabilis-bilis naman kung sinasabi nilang automated na? Pero bakit ganito pa rin?\n\nSa katunayan po ay ang dapat na suweldo namin para sa Hunyo 15-30, 2014 ay hanggang ngayon (24 araw na ang nakalilipas) hindi pa namin nakukuha.\n\nNarinig ko rin po na ang mga J.O. sa accounting ay nakakuha na ng kanilang sahod sa panahong sinabi ko. Magsisinungaling po ako kung sasabihin kong hindi ako naiinggit sa kanila. Ang tanong ko po ay bakit ganoon? Kapag po ba taga-Accounting ay mauunang magsuweldo kumpara sa taga-ibang opisina? Hindi naman po tama iyon.\n\nMarahil sasabihin ng iba na maliit na bagay lamang itong aking reklamo para problemahin ng inyong opisina subalit dito na lamang po ako umaasa na kahit papaano ay matutugunan itong aming hiling. Ilan na rin po kasing mga J.O. ang ipinarating ito sa mga opisinang humahawak sa sahod, subalit wala pa rin pong nagbago. Dagdag pa po ang masusungit na staff ng accounting na ayaw magpa-follow-up. Hindi naman po sana kami palagiang pupunta sa kanila kung naibibigay lamang sa amin ang aming suweldo (na karapatan naming makuha) kung naibibigay nila ito sa amin ng mas maaga.\n\nWala rin po kaming basehan kung kailan ba matatapos ang kanilang mga proseso, kaya araw-araw na lang po kaming aasa na sasahod na kami. Sana ay bigyan nila kami ng abiso kung gaano katagal kami maghihintay. Para naman masabi ko sa aking pinagkakautangan na sa susunod na linggo ko pa mababayaran ang hiniram kong pera (na nagastos ko sa pagpasok sa trabaho), dahil mededelay daw nang tatlong linggo ang suweldo ko.\n\nBilang isang ordinaryong manggagawa na umaasa sa sahod para makaraos sa araw-araw (makakain, makabayad ng bills, makatulong sa magulang, makapasok ng trabaho) at pilit na pinagkakasya sana ang maliit na sahod ay labis pong nadidismaya sa sistemang ito.\n\nNapakahirap pong pumasok sa trabaho na madalas ay walang pera, puro utang, at hindi alam kung kailan magkakaroon ng pera mula sa sahod.\n\nAng nangyayari, sa halip po na kami ang makatulong sa aming mga magulang ay kami pa po ang sinusuportahan sa pang-baon namin sa araw-araw.\n\nAko po, at ang lahat ng mga J.O. sa DPWH ay maswerte na mayroon kaming trabaho, subalit sa ganitong lagay na laging delayed ang suweldo ay kami, at ang aming mga pamilya ay kaawa-awa. \n\nBukod sa nais naming maghatid ng serbisyo-publiko, kami rin naman po ay nagtatrabaho para sumuweldo. Nakakadismaya lang na nangyayari ito.\n\n\nMaraming salamat po.\n\n\n\nLabis na gumagalang,\nAnonymous\n"}, {"category": "6", "id": "CFMC-20151192", "body": "Good Afternoon po Ma'am dito po kami sa Sitio San Roque, Brgy.

At the curb when I was about to board the jeepney, my left foot was caught by a metal rod sticking out near the canal which caused me to fall flat on my face. Hardest hit was my left knee bone which became black and blue, with some abrasions on my face and hands. My pair of double vision eye glasses is completely unusable now. Was very glad some children (jeepney dispatchers I believe), pulled me up. Then two SM security men came to my aid and brought me to the SM Mall clinic to be checked, as I was limping hard due to the injury on my left leg. I very much appreciate the very solicitous attention also of the clinic nurses, especially tending to a senior citizen like me. I was told by the security men that the long metal rod which tripped me is part of the DPWH project being performed at present. Question: I was wondering if DPWH would also pay attention to a senior citizen like me. Am actually relying only on my meager SSS pension, which cannot support medical check-ups which I may have to undergo because of my accident. The SM clinic nurse recommended that I see a doctor to evaluate my accident and undergo lab tests, etc. I may need MRI, brain scan, etc., as my head hit the pavement quite hard. At this point I am not hesitant to ask some assistance from your august office. You perform grate infrastructure work, but sometimes you also have to pay attention to Filipino citizens like us, especially who are senior citizens. Would truly appreciate if I could be given attention by your office. I do not have sufficient funding to take care of my medical needs. May I count on your response and support?

Herrera Sr. Memorial elementary School at Wawa, Pilar, Bataan. I just to want to post my concern regarding with the miscalculations made with the project sited on our school with SARO No. SARO-BMB-A-13-T000002341. the title of the said project was construction/repair of School Building amounting to PhP 150,000.00. name of Contractor: NV Balbuena Construction; Implementing Office: DPWH-Bataan 2nd District; Source of Fund: PDAF Lower House. the said project was a construction/ repair of school building but then the contractor just replaced the ceiling with 67pcs of ordinary plywood and installed 8 sets of fluorescent lights. i even called DPWH Bataan to confirm the inclusions sited in the program of work, they confirmed to me that it was just a repair of ceiling. but on my surprise, in the stated program of work, replacement of ceiling joints was also included. on the contrary, the contractor did not actually replaced the said ceiling joints but instead they just used the same old ceiling joints. the workers did not also replaced the cenepa on the other side which made the ceiling opened. they even repaired certain portions of the roofings of the said building so there will be no leaks during rainy season but then, they didnt replaced it a new one but instead they just get 20pcs of used G.I. sheets which were attached to the condemnable building located inside the school premises. the tarpaulin posted on our school fence stated that the started date was June 24, 2013 and contract completion date was july 13, 2013. In actuality they just worked for five (5) days in staggard schedule. May I just ask for an inspection regarding this matter? and is it not not necessary for us school heads to sign a completion report of a project within our jurisdiction? May we continue to deal with our obligations honestly and religiously. thank you and i''m looking forward for an immediate response regarding this matter.\n\nJoseph Ralph Dizon\nfollow me on twitter @ralphie_pie\n047-633-0920 ; 0917-5153139"}, {"category": "6", "id": "CFMC-20151311", "body": "Presidential intercession with no assigned Code Number, relative to the letter of Mayor Mary Joyce M.

It was originally a provincial road as seen in old titles and map but turned to a barangay road now. It is a 500m road rehabilitation I think to replace the asphalt road here in Brgy Maturanoc, Guimba, Nueva Ecija. I have two concerns about the construction sir. It is only a barangay road now and its elevation is too high after the construction is done, another sir is that i don't see that putting sands on top of an asphalt before concreting will not affect its stability. I'll be glad to hear from you sir since i'm not familiar with engineering works especially road construction. Thank you very much sir. Good day again sir. An Engineer already showed up here a while ago and showed the plan for the road rehabilitation project here. Additional query sir, take note sir that the asphalt is already jack hammered and holes are made before they put sand on top of it. What we think is that it should be done only when the asphalt is for removal. The road is not in a flood prone area so i think there is no need to elevate the road too much cause it will just add to its instability. If that should be the case then we have to rehabilitate also our houses to get along with the new elevation of the road after the construction. Thank you again sir.
